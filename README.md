# echo_nest_love_like

My goal in this project is to build a personalized music classifier.  

The directory "first ensemble" is my first stab at a classifier that would sort music recommendations based on probaility that a user will like them.

The directory "social network approach" is a first stab at generating recommendations for the classifier above.  It uses the "similar artists" feature on Echo Nest to generate a huge graph of artists that are then sorted based on centrality metrics.

The first part of this project is documented on my [blog](goodwordalchemy.com)
