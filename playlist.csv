He is best known among mainstream audiences for songs like ""Sittin' in Limbo"", ""You Can Get It If You Really Want,"" ""Many Rivers to Cross"" and the title track from The Harder They Come, a film soundtrack which helped popularise reggae across the world.  Cliff moved to Kingston in 1962. After he released two singles that failed to make much of an impression, his career took off when his ""Hurricane Hattie"" became a hit, while he was aged just 14; it was produced by Leslie Kong, with whom Cliff would remain until Kong's death. Later local hit singles included ""King of Kings"", ""Dearest Beverley"" and ""Pride and Passion"". In 1964, Cliff was chosen as one of the Jamaican representatives at the World's Fair, and Cliff soon signed to Island Records and moved to Britain. Island initially (and unsuccessfully) tried to sell Cliff to the rock audience, but his career took off in the late 1960s. His international debut album was Hard Road to Travel, which received excellent reviews and included ""Waterfall"", a Brazilian hit that won the International Song Festival.  ""Waterfall"" was followed in 1969 by ""Wonderful World, Beautiful People"" and ""Vietnam"" in 1970, both popular throughout most of the world. Folk rock singer-songwriter Bob Dylan even called ""Vietnam"" the best protest song he'd ever heard. Wonderful World included a cover of Cat Stevens' ""Wild World"", which was a success in 1970.  Leslie Kong died of a heart attack in 1971. The soundtrack to the reggae film The Harder They Come was a huge success that sold well across the world, but did not break Cliff into the mainstream. After a series of albums, Cliff took a break and traveled to Africa, exploring his newfound Muslim spirituality. He quickly returned to music, touring for several years before he recorded with Kool & the Gang for Power & the Glory (1983). (During the 1981 River Tour, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band added Cliff's little-known ""Trapped"" to their live set; it achieved great prominence when included on 1985's We Are the World benefit album.) The follow-up, Cliff Hanger (1985) won a Grammy Award, though it was his last major success in the U.S. until 1993. He continued to sell well in Jamaica and, to a lesser extent, the UK, returning to the mainstream pop charts in the U.S. and elsewhere with a version of Johnny Nash's ""I Can See Clearly Now"" on the Cool Runnings film soundtrack in 1993 .  In 2002, Cliff released his new album, Fantastic Plastic People in Europe, after first providing free downloads using Delacove's People Music Media p2p software. This album featured collaborations with Joe Strummer, Annie Lennox, and Sting as well as new songs that were very reminiscent of Cliff's original hits. In 2004 Cliff completely reworked the songs, dropping the traditional reggae in favor of an electronica sound, for inclusion in Black Magic.  Cliff has also covered the famous African song ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"".  His recording of 'You Can Get It If You Really Want' was used as a campaign anthem by the Sandinista National Liberation Front in the 1990 election in Nicaragua (they lost). It was also adopted by the British Conservative Party during their annual conference in October, 2007. It is unclear whether Mr Cliff endorsed either party.

Cliff is best known among mainstream audiences for songs such as ""Wonderful World, Beautiful People"", ""The Harder They Come"", ""Sitting in Limbo"", ""You Can Get It If You Really Want"" and ""Many Rivers to Cross"" from the soundtrack to The Harder They Come, which helped popularize reggae across the world, and his covers of Cat Stevens' ""Wild World"" and Johnny Nash's ""I Can See Clearly Now"" from the film Cool Runnings. He starred in the film The Harder They Come. Cliff was one of five performers inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010. 

Career:

Early life, 1960s and 1970s:
Jimmy Cliff was born in Somerton District, St. James, Jamaica. He began writing songs while still at primary school in St. James, listening to a neighbour's sound system. In 1962 his father took him to Kingston to go to Kingston Technical school, where he ended up sharing his cousin's one rented room in East Kingston. 
Cliff sought out many producers while still going to school, trying to get his songs recorded without success. He also entered talent contests. ""One night I was walking past a record store and restaurant as they were closing, pushed myself in and convinced one of them, Leslie Kong, to go into the recording business, starting with me,"" he writes in his own website biography. After two singles that failed to make much impression, his career took off when ""Hurricane Hattie"" became a hit, while he was aged 14. It was produced by Kong, with whom Cliff remained until Kong's death from a heart attack in 1971. 
Cliff's later local hit singles included ""King of Kings"", ""Dearest Beverley"", ""Miss Jamaica"", and ""Pride and Passion"". In 1964, Cliff was chosen as one of Jamaica's representatives at the world's fair. He soon signed to Island Records and moved to the United Kingdom. Island Records initially (and unsuccessfully) tried to sell Cliff to the rock audience, but his career took off in the late 1960s. His international debut album was Hard Road to Travel, released in 1967. It received excellent reviews and included ""Waterfall"" (composed by Nirvana's Alex Spyropoulos and Patrick Campbell-Lyons), which became a hit in Brazil and won the International Song Festival. 
""Waterfall"" was followed in 1969 by ""Wonderful World, Beautiful People"" and ""Vietnam"" in 1970, both popular throughout most of the world. Bob Dylan called ""Vietnam"" the best protest song he had ever heard. Also during this period, Cliff released a cover of Cat Stevens' ""Wild World"" as a single, but it was not included on his Wonderful World, Beautiful People album. 
In 1972, Cliff starred as Ivanhoe ""Ivan"" Martin in the classic reggae film, The Harder They Come, directed by Perry Henzell. As the film tells Martin's story, he is a young man without funds. Arriving in Kingston from the country, he tries to make it in the recording business, but without success. Eventually, he turns to a life of crime. The soundtrack album of the film was a huge success that sold well across the world, bringing reggae to an international audience for the first time. It remains one of the most internationally significant films to have come out of Jamaica since independence. The film made its debut at London's Gaumont cinema in Notting Hill on 1 September 1972. In 1975, Cliff sang on the first season of Saturday Night Live, episode 12, hosted by Dick Cavett. After a series of albums, Cliff took a break and traveled to Africa (the Nigeria-based Jamaican writer Lindsay Barrett was instrumental in Cliff's first trip there), and subsequently converted to Islam, taking the new name: El Hadj Naïm Bachir. 

1980s and 1990s:
Cliff quickly returned to music, touring for several years before he recorded with Kool & the Gang. In 1984, Cliff appeared at the Pinkpop Festival in Landgraaf, Netherlands. During The River Tour, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band added Cliff's previously little-known song ""Trapped"" to their live set; it achieved great prominence when included on 1985's We Are the World benefit album. The follow-up, Cliff Hanger (1985) won a Grammy Award for 'Best Reggae Album', though it was his last major success in the United States until 1993. Also in 1985, Cliff contributed to the song ""Sun City"", a protest song written and composed by Steven Van Zandt and recorded by Artists United Against Apartheid to convey opposition to the South African policy of apartheid. Cliff then provided backing vocals on The Rolling Stones' 1986 album, Dirty Work and appeared in the comedy Club Paradise, co-starring with Robin Williams and Peter O'Toole, and contributed several songs to the soundtrack, including ""Seven Day Weekend"", which he sang with Elvis Costello. In 1988, his song ""Shelter of Your Love"" was featured in the hit film Cocktail. 
Cliff appeared in the film Marked for Death in 1990, performing ""John Crow"" with the Jimmy Cliff Band. His recording of ""You Can Get It If You Really Want"" was used as a campaign anthem by the Sandinista National Liberation Front in the 1990 election in Nicaragua. In 1991, performed at the second Rock in Rio festival in Estádio do Maracanã in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He continued to sell well in Jamaica and, to a lesser extent, the UK, returning to the mainstream pop charts in the U.S. and elsewhere (#1 in France) with a version of Johnny Nash's ""I Can See Clearly Now"" on the Cool Runnings film soundtrack in 1993. In 1995, Cliff released the single ""Hakuna Matata"", a collaboration with Lebo M, a song from the soundtrack of the film The Lion King. 

After 2000:

Cliff became an inaugural member of the Independent Music Awards' judging panel to support independent artists. In 2002, Cliff released the album Fantastic Plastic People in Europe, after first providing free downloads using p2p software. This album featured collaborations with Joe Strummer, Annie Lennox, and Sting as well as new songs that were very reminiscent of Cliff's original hits. In 2004, Cliff completely reworked the songs, dropping the traditional reggae in favour of an electronic sound, for inclusion in Black Magic. The album also included a recording of ""Over the Border"" with Joe Strummer. Cliff performed at the closing ceremony to the 2002 Commonwealth Games and in 2003, his song ""You Can Get It If You Really Want"" was included in the soundtrack to the film, Something's Gotta Give. He also appeared in July 2003 at the Paléo Festival in Nyon, Switzerland. The Jamaican government under P. J. Patterson honoured Cliff on 20 October 2003, by awarding him The Order of Merit, the nation's third-highest honour, in recognition of his contributions to the film and music of Jamaica. Cliff and Mervyn Morris are the only currently living figures from the arts to hold this distinction and he is the only living musician to do so. 
In 2007, Cliff performed at the opening ceremony at cricket's World Cup. In the spring and summer of 2010, Cliff embarked on an extensive tour of the U.S. and Canada. In 2009, ""You Can Get It If You Really Want"" was adopted by the British Conservative Party during their annual conference in October 2007. It is unclear whether Cliff endorsed the political party. In September 2009, he was nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, following a campaign on his behalf by the American, Charles Earle. Cliff reacted to the news by saying, ""This is good for Cliff, good for Jamaican music and good for my country."" On 15 December 2009, he was officially announced as an inductee and was inducted on 15 March 2010 by Wyclef Jean. 

In 2011, Cliff worked with producer Tim Armstrong, singer of the band Rancid, on The Sacred Fire EP and the full-length album Rebirth.Rebirth was nominated for a Grammy Award for 'Best Reggae Album'. The album was listed at #12 on Rolling Stone's list of the top 50 albums of 2012, saying ""There's ska, rock steady, roots reggae, a revelatory cover of The Clash's ""Guns of Brixton"" delivered in Cliff's trademark soulful tenor, grittier but still lovely more than 40 years after his debut."" In December 2012, Cliff was named 'Artist of the Year' by digital newspaper the Caribbean Journal, citing his work on Rebirth. 

Personal life:
Cliff is not a Rasta, though he was briefly in between converting from Christianity to Islam. He now has a ""universal outlook on life"", and does not align himself with any particular movement or religion. ""Now I believe in science,"" he has said.

Their music is difficult to define, straddling both world and rock and often imbued with timeless Hispano - classical influences. The fire in their music comes from their life-long passion for metal music. In spring 2006, ""Rodrigo y Gabriela,"" beat both the Arctic Monkeys AND Johnny Cash to number one in the Irish charts. Both the artists and their third self-titled album have gone on to enjoy international success since its initial release in early 2006.  Rodrigo is a deft finger-picker who can move from raging speed to sensual soul in the space of a fret, while Gabriela employs fast, rhythmic techniques. Her percussionist's thrashing of strings and drumming of the instrument's body inevitably raises comparisons with the flamenco style of rumba, but the band specifically denies a flamenco influence. Nonetheless, it is often referred to as ""nuevo flamenco"", symbolising a sort of renaissance of the traditionally Spanish music genre whose origins began in the Middle East when the Moors brought their cultural music to Europe. The duo's repertoire flies beyond familiar latin folk guitarists' styles because of the metal connection: their reworkings of Led Zeppelin's ""Stairway to Heaven"" and Metallica's ""Orion"" are musts, and the presence on ""Ixtapa"" of the fiery hungarian gypsy violinist Roby Lakatos is inspirational.  The Story: Rodrigo and Gabriela met as teenagers, at the Casa de Cultura (House of Culture), in Mexico City, where Rodrigo's brother was Director. Rodrigo was playing drums in his band Castlow - a code word he never revealed to Gabriela, and changed to Tierra Acida (Acid Earth) when she joined them on guitar. The couple drifted together through music; teenaged metal fanatics who both failed entrance to the Conservatory and moved into rock. Before joining Tierra Acida, Gabriela ran three girls' bands, Las Brujas (The Witches), Subterraneo and Las Formigas (The Ants) at once: Terra Acida had a disciplined work ethic: ""It was mental!"" she recalls, ""we rehearsed five hours a day, every day, with very short breaks, and not much talking!""   Tierra Acida played in Mexico City's roughest clubs and lived off day-jobs (Gabriela taught Metallica riffs to local kids; Rodrigo at a TV station, doing music for programmes). They recorded an album but wouldn't sign the record contract, planning instead to concentrate on learning more guitar styles. In fact, they just hung out with friends and survived by playing bossa novas in the hotel bars. ""Then we decided to travel to Europe"".  Their first port of call was Dublin, Ireland. ""It was the most unknown place to us"", explains Gabriela, the talkative one. ""Also, a Mexican girl offered us her house there."" They landed in Dublin at night, spoke no English, and had $1,000 between them. They found a note on the door saying actually, sorry, but they couldn't stay there after all, so the taxi driver drove them round hostels and hotels all night. Eventually they rented a place - and soon the money disappeared: ""So - we had to busk"". That was 1999: ""We were very exotic specimens!"" They built a reputation and landed gigs in people's homes, at wedding parties and gallery openings, playing covers and their own compositions, ""We still wanted to be metal composers, but everything came out as Latin!""   Dublin was booming then, with new music venues and galleries and a thriving rock scene, and the two Mexicans jammed with local folk musicians in the bars. In winter, they moved to Denmark and started again - this time busking at minus three degrees! The brief Copenhagen experience inspired two numbers on the current album, ""Diablo Rojo"", a scary roller-coaster ride in the city, and ""Viking Man"", their nickname for a homeless man they befriended, who pushed them into busking on the freezing streets.   Next, they hit Barcelona, but this time, the club owners assumed they played mariachi, and wouldn't let them play in their own unique style, so Rod & Gab ended up jamming on Barca's main drag Las Ramblas getting heavy duty hassle from the Catalan cops. Just in time, a call came from Ireland to come back and play the newly opened Sugar Club. Damian Rice, then a busking friend, invited them to support his shows, and in 2003, they released ""re-Foc"", and a year later, ""Live Manchester And Dublin,"" which both launched them onto the world music circuit - and beyond.   The Music: Rodrigo and Gabriela describe their style as 'fusion music': ""It's mainly got latin harmonies and rhythms but the structure is rock. It's not jazz because it's structured, and we don't improvise; our solos are exactly what's on the record, as a metal fan and guitarist you always want to hear the same f**king solo!""  Influences range from family salsa records to Gabriela's aunt's pink floyd, black sabbath, queen, and led zeppelin vinyl, with Rodrigo also embracing a similar classic rock lineage. But crucially they grew up during Mexico's 'metal era.' ""People expected two acoustic guitarists would play classical music, but we dropped in extracts from Led Zep, Hendrix and Metallica, then we did the same with ""Stairway to Heaven!"" Their music is instrumental ""with very lyrical themes.""  Mentions of flamenco influences raise sharp responses: ""To many music fans, it sounds like flamenco, and we're great flamenco fans, but we don't play it"" says Gabriela. ""The only similarity is that our music is guitar music and it's very rhythmic.""  This album's producer John Leckie (Radiohead, Muse, My Morning Jacket) arrived on the scene via a demo sent to him by their Irish record label, and he called the very next day. The three agreed to record 'live', and Rodrigo and Gabriela were placed in the same room in a studio in Bath, England, to perform as if on stage: ""We played each track over and over, and only 'Orion' has overdubs."" Roby Lakatos, the fiery gypsy violinist was the only outsider, and his presence on ""Ixtapa"" is wonderful. ""We saw him on TV"", Gabriela remembers, ""Playing at a concert in Amsterdam, and we sent him our music. He improvised this whole piece in two hours!"" From the many, many live versions, Leckie chose 'the one.'   The Touring The global success of 'Rodrigo y Gabriela' (300,000 worldwide sales and counting) has been spurred on by Rod & Gab's dedication to hard work on the road. 2006 saw three UK tours and three US tours, plus extensive European and Australian sojourns. 2007 has seen them back in the United States (once Rodrigo's visa problems were sorted out by the State Department) and the UK for many more shows, including festival spots at Coachella, Glastonbury, V, Bonnaroo, Oxegen (Ireland), Latitude, Pukkelpop (Belgium), Lowlands (The Netherlands) and countless others.

It's easy to forget sometimes. Like when ..., Rodrigo y Gabriela (Rodrigo and Gabriela) are a Mexican acoustic guitar duo whose music is influenced by a number of genres including nuevo flamenco, rock, and heavy metal. The duo's recordings consist largely of instrumental duets on the classical guitar. Currently residing in Mexico City, they began their career in Dublin, Ireland, during an eight-year stay. They have released five studio albums, three live albums and one EP. In 2011 they collaborated with Hans Zimmer on the Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides soundtrack while also contributing to the soundtrack for the Shrek prequel Puss in Boots. They have toured internationally and in May 2010, performed at The White House for President Barack Obama. 

Early life:
Rodrigo Sánchez (born 1974) and Gabriela Quintero (born 1973) grew up in middle-class families in Mexico City. Their parents listened to flamenco, jazz, and rock music but they were both exposed to heavy metal, like Metallica, which proved influential to Rodrigo and Gabriela. 
Rodrigo and Gabriela met at the age of 15, at the Casa de Cultura (House of Culture) in Mexico City, where Rodrigo's brother was the director. Quintero was in a drama class and at the suggestion of his brother, Rodrigo met up with her. She remembers ""this 15-year-old boy there, dressed in a black ... with messy hair. Yet he was different to the other metal-heads his age: he seemed very serious and didn't drink or smoke"". The two bonded over their interest in music and they soon became a couple. 
In the early 1990s, Sánchez formed a heavy metal band called Tierra Acida (Acid Land) with his brother. Quintero joined them in 1993 ""as they couldn't get a guitarist who would please Rodrigo"". When a record deal for the band fell through in 1997, Sánchez and Quintero left Mexico City for the resort town of Ixtapa on the Pacific coast of Mexico. They played in beach side bars and hotels for nine months where ""we wanted to play a different kind of music, something we could make as our own"". 

Career:
Growing frustrated with the limited scope of the domestic Mexican music scene, the duo moved to Europe. After travelling around, they took up residence in Dublin, Ireland, in 1999, despite not speaking any English. Playing live gigs in various pubs and busking on Grafton Street where they began to play ""many cover songs, which we enjoyed. Then we began to put in our own songs, and we've built up our repertoire from there"". They became friends with fellow musician Damien Rice who invited them to open for one of his shows. He also introduced the duo to Niall Muckian, who became their manager. In the first half of 2001 they recorded a 9-track demo called Foc of their own material supplemented by some covers, also featuring an appearance by Zoe Conway. 
As interest in the band grew, it was decided to re-record the songs on the demo as re-Foc in 2002 with a number of friends, including Lisa Hannigan who provided vocal stylings and Conway, who by now also was a feature of the live set-up of the duo. The album appeared on Muckian's own Rubyworks Records as he found that ""because it is all instrumental, we found it hard to get major-label interest or any radio-play, so I put it out myself"". As interest grew, the duo were offered further support-slots, which resulted in an eight-track live-album recorded in Dublin and Manchester, released in 2004. 
The eponymous album, Rodrigo y Gabriela, entered the Irish Albums Chart at #1 beating Arctic Monkeys and Johnny Cash to the top spot. It was released internationally on March 13, 2006, having been given an earlier Irish release. Rodrigo y Gabriela, which was produced by John Leckie, includes covers of Led Zeppelin's ""Stairway to Heaven"" and Metallica's ""Orion"". The duo lists Metallica as being among their key influences, alongside other heavy metal bands such as Megadeth, Slayer, Testament and Overkill. The other tracks are original works inspired by the places they have been and the people they have met. 
The duo had their national American TV debut on Late Show with David Letterman on December 18, 2006, performing ""Diablo Rojo"". 

Their song ""Tamacun"" featured in the pilot episode of AMC's Breaking Bad in January 2008. 
Live in Japan was released on October 20, 2008, in the United Kingdom, and includes 14 tracks, and a bonus DVD containing five videos. The Led Zeppelin cover can be found on the album Rhythms del Mundo Classics. 
Their feature on MTV gave them a huge boost in popularity in the United States. This led to a feature on Nightmare Revisited, a tribute album to the music from Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas. The duo performed an instrumental version of ""Oogie Boogie's Song."" 
They released a new album, 11:11, in September, 2009. Alex Skolnick of Testament guests on the album, as do Strunz & Farah. Upon the release of the new album, they received much mainstream American popularity and were the featured music on Monday Night Football on October 12, 2009, as they celebrated Latino Heritage Month. 
Their song ""Santo Domingo"" was chosen as the Starbucks iTunes Pick of the Week for November 10, 2009. 
The duo was the musical guest on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson that aired on CBS-TV on October 28, 2009, and was re-run on December 29, 2009. They performed ""Buster Voodoo."" They performed on Jools Holland's Annual Hootenanny on December 31, 2009. 
The duo was the musical guest on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno that aired on NBC on March 23, 2010, to promote their album 11:11 and on Lopez Tonight which aired on TBS March 25, 2010. 

They headlined the West Holts stage on the Sunday night at Glastonbury 2010 and played the King Tuts Tent at T In The Park on 10 July 2010. They also had a spot on the main stage at Latitude festival that same July and they managed to draw in a huge crowd. 
In 2010, Rodrigo y Gabriela contributed a live version of their song ""Hora Zero"" to the Enough Project and Downtown Records' Raise Hope for Congo compilation. Proceeds from the compilation fund efforts to make the protection and empowerment of Congo's women a priority, as well as inspire individuals around the world to raise their voice for peace in the Congo. 
They played the Nice Jazz Festival on 23 July 2010, and the McMenamin's Edgefield outdoor concert in Portland, Oregon on August 14, 2010, as well as the Ravinia Festival on August 28, 2010, and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on September 30, 2010. 
In September, 2010, the duo announced a hiatus from touring due to stress injuries caused by Gabriela's heavily percussive style of playing. However, they did manage to play five sold-out nights at Shepherds Bush in London. 
On January 20, 2011, Rodrigo y Gabriela entered the studio with Hans Zimmer to write and record sessions of the score from Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. The soundtrack was released on May 17, 2011, three days before the film's general release.

In January 2012 they released Area 52, their first album backed by other musicians. The tracks on the album are mostly re-worked versions of songs that have appeared on their duo albums, Rodrigo y Gabriela and 11:11. Reviews were mixed, with some tracks criticised for the backing band drowning out the guitar work that fans love but others praised where the guitar workouts ""are allowed space to breathe by lighter salsa-style backing."" 
In April 2014, Rodrigo y Gabriela released their fourth studio album, entitled 9 Dead Alive. 

Style:
Reviewing one of their gigs, The Independent noted that ""Rodrigo y Gabriela's secret is maybe quite simple. They are resourceful musicians, and are open-hearted, happy entertainers. That, very often, is what people want."" 
Both Rodrigo and Gabriela play Yamaha NX series electro nylon string guitars exclusively. Rodrigo plays the slimmer neck NTX1200 and Gabriela plays the more traditional sized NCX2000 and NCX1200. 

Personal lives:
Sánchez and Quintero dated for many years before ending their relationship (but not their musical partnership) in 2012. ""We're now better friends by far,"" said Quintero. ""We no longer behave like 15-year-olds and it's allowed us to grow up.""

The fire in their music comes from their life-long passion for metal music. In spring 2006, ""Rodrigo y Gabriela,"" beat both the Arctic Monkeys AND Johnny Cash to number one in the Irish charts. Both the artists and their third self-titled album have gone on to enjoy international success since its initial release in early 2006.  Rodrigo is a deft finger-picker who can move from raging speed to sensual soul in the space of a fret, while Gabriela employs fast, rhythmic techniques. Her percussionist's thrashing of strings and drumming of the instrument's body inevitably raises comparisons with the flamenco style of rumba, but the band specifically denies a flamenco influence. Nonetheless, it is often referred to as ""nuevo flamenco"", symbolising a sort of renaissance of the traditionally Spanish music genre whose origins began in the Middle East when the Moors brought their cultural music to Europe. The duo's repertoire flies beyond familiar latin folk guitarists' styles because of the metal connection: their reworkings of Led Zeppelin's ""Stairway to Heaven"" and Metallica's ""Orion"" are musts, and the presence on ""Ixtapa"" of the fiery hungarian gypsy violinist Roby Lakatos is inspirational.  The Story: Rodrigo and Gabriela met as teenagers, at the Casa de Cultura (House of Culture), in Mexico City, where Rodrigo's brother was Director. Rodrigo was playing drums in his band Castlow - a code word he never revealed to Gabriela, and changed to Tierra Acida (Acid Earth) when she joined them on guitar. The couple drifted together through music; teenaged metal fanatics who both failed entrance to the Conservatory and moved into rock. Before joining Tierra Acida, Gabriela ran three girls' bands, Las Brujas (The Witches), Subterraneo and Las Formigas (The Ants) at once: Terra Acida had a disciplined work ethic: ""It was mental!"" she recalls, ""we rehearsed five hours a day, every day, with very short breaks, and not much talking!""   Tierra Acida played in Mexico City's roughest clubs and lived off day-jobs (Gabriela taught Metallica riffs to local kids; Rodrigo at a TV station, doing music for programmes). They recorded an album but wouldn't sign the record contract, planning instead to concentrate on learning more guitar styles. In fact, they just hung out with friends and survived by playing bossa novas in the hotel bars. ""Then we decided to travel to Europe"".  Their first port of call was Dublin, Ireland. ""It was the most unknown place to us"", explains Gabriela, the talkative one. ""Also, a Mexican girl offered us her house there."" They landed in Dublin at night, spoke no English, and had $1,000 between them. They found a note on the door saying actually, sorry, but they couldn't stay there after all, so the taxi driver drove them round hostels and hotels all night. Eventually they rented a place - and soon the money disappeared: ""So - we had to busk"". That was 1999: ""We were very exotic specimens!"" They built a reputation and landed gigs in people's homes, at wedding parties and gallery openings, playing covers and their own compositions, ""We still wanted to be metal composers, but everything came out as Latin!""   Dublin was booming then, with new music venues and galleries and a thriving rock scene, and the two Mexicans jammed with local folk musicians in the bars. In winter, they moved to Denmark and started again - this time busking at minus three degrees! The brief Copenhagen experience inspired two numbers on the current album, ""Diablo Rojo"", a scary roller-coaster ride in the city, and ""Viking Man"", their nickname for a homeless man they befriended, who pushed them into busking on the freezing streets.   Next, they hit Barcelona, but this time, the club owners assumed they played mariachi, and wouldn't let them play in their own unique style, so Rod & Gab ended up jamming on Barca's main drag Las Ramblas getting heavy duty hassle from the Catalan cops. Just in time, a call came from Ireland to come back and play the newly opened Sugar Club. Damian Rice, then a busking friend, invited them to support his shows, and in 2003, they released ""re-Foc"", and a year later, ""Live Manchester And Dublin,"" which both launched them onto the world music circuit - and beyond.   The Music: Rodrigo and Gabriela describe their style as 'fusion music': ""It's mainly got latin harmonies and rhythms but the structure is rock. It's not jazz because it's structured, and we don't improvise; our solos are exactly what's on the record, as a metal fan and guitarist you always want to hear the same f**king solo!""  Influences range from family salsa records to Gabriela's aunt's pink floyd, black sabbath, queen, and led zeppelin vinyl, with Rodrigo also embracing a similar classic rock lineage. But crucially they grew up during Mexico's 'metal era.' ""People expected two acoustic guitarists would play classical music, but we dropped in extracts from Led Zep, Hendrix and Metallica, then we did the same with ""Stairway to Heaven!"" Their music is instrumental ""with very lyrical themes.""  Mentions of flamenco influences raise sharp responses: ""To many music fans, it sounds like flamenco, and we're great flamenco fans, but we don't play it"" says Gabriela. ""The only similarity is that our music is guitar music and it's very rhythmic.""  This album's producer John Leckie (Radiohead, Muse, My Morning Jacket) arrived on the scene via a demo sent to him by their Irish record label, and he called the very next day. The three agreed to record 'live', and Rodrigo and Gabriela were placed in the same room in a studio in Bath, England, to perform as if on stage: ""We played each track over and over, and only 'Orion' has overdubs."" Roby Lakatos, the fiery gypsy violinist was the only outsider, and his presence on ""Ixtapa"" is wonderful. ""We saw him on TV"", Gabriela remembers, ""Playing at a concert in Amsterdam, and we sent him our music. He improvised this whole piece in two hours!"" From the many, many live versions, Leckie chose 'the one.'   The Touring The global success of 'Rodrigo y Gabriela' (300,000 worldwide sales and counting) has been spurred on by Rod & Gab's dedication to hard work on the road. 2006 saw three UK tours and three US tours, plus extensive European and Australian sojourns. 2007 has seen them back in the United States (once Rodrigo's visa problems were sorted out by the State Department) and the UK for many more shows, including festival spots at Coachella, Glastonbury, V, Bonnaroo, Oxegen (Ireland), Latitude, Pukkelpop (Belgium), Lowlands (The Netherlands) and countless others.

It's easy to forget sometimes. Like when ..., Rodrigo y Gabriela (Rodrigo and Gabriela) are a Mexican acoustic guitar duo whose music is influenced by a number of genres including nuevo flamenco, rock, and heavy metal. The duo's recordings consist largely of instrumental duets on the classical guitar. Currently residing in Mexico City, they began their career in Dublin, Ireland, during an eight-year stay. They have released five studio albums, three live albums and one EP. In 2011 they collaborated with Hans Zimmer on the Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides soundtrack while also contributing to the soundtrack for the Shrek prequel Puss in Boots. They have toured internationally and in May 2010, performed at The White House for President Barack Obama. 

Early life:
Rodrigo Sánchez (born 1974) and Gabriela Quintero (born 1973) grew up in middle-class families in Mexico City. Their parents listened to flamenco, jazz, and rock music but they were both exposed to heavy metal, like Metallica, which proved influential to Rodrigo and Gabriela. 
Rodrigo and Gabriela met at the age of 15, at the Casa de Cultura (House of Culture) in Mexico City, where Rodrigo's brother was the director. Quintero was in a drama class and at the suggestion of his brother, Rodrigo met up with her. She remembers ""this 15-year-old boy there, dressed in a black ... with messy hair. Yet he was different to the other metal-heads his age: he seemed very serious and didn't drink or smoke"". The two bonded over their interest in music and they soon became a couple. 
In the early 1990s, Sánchez formed a heavy metal band called Tierra Acida (Acid Land) with his brother. Quintero joined them in 1993 ""as they couldn't get a guitarist who would please Rodrigo"". When a record deal for the band fell through in 1997, Sánchez and Quintero left Mexico City for the resort town of Ixtapa on the Pacific coast of Mexico. They played in beach side bars and hotels for nine months where ""we wanted to play a different kind of music, something we could make as our own"". 

Career:
Growing frustrated with the limited scope of the domestic Mexican music scene, the duo moved to Europe. After travelling around, they took up residence in Dublin, Ireland, in 1999, despite not speaking any English. Playing live gigs in various pubs and busking on Grafton Street where they began to play ""many cover songs, which we enjoyed. Then we began to put in our own songs, and we've built up our repertoire from there"". They became friends with fellow musician Damien Rice who invited them to open for one of his shows. He also introduced the duo to Niall Muckian, who became their manager. In the first half of 2001 they recorded a 9-track demo called Foc of their own material supplemented by some covers, also featuring an appearance by Zoe Conway. 
As interest in the band grew, it was decided to re-record the songs on the demo as re-Foc in 2002 with a number of friends, including Lisa Hannigan who provided vocal stylings and Conway, who by now also was a feature of the live set-up of the duo. The album appeared on Muckian's own Rubyworks Records as he found that ""because it is all instrumental, we found it hard to get major-label interest or any radio-play, so I put it out myself"". As interest grew, the duo were offered further support-slots, which resulted in an eight-track live-album recorded in Dublin and Manchester, released in 2004. 
The eponymous album, Rodrigo y Gabriela, entered the Irish Albums Chart at #1 beating Arctic Monkeys and Johnny Cash to the top spot. It was released internationally on March 13, 2006, having been given an earlier Irish release. Rodrigo y Gabriela, which was produced by John Leckie, includes covers of Led Zeppelin's ""Stairway to Heaven"" and Metallica's ""Orion"". The duo lists Metallica as being among their key influences, alongside other heavy metal bands such as Megadeth, Slayer, Testament and Overkill. The other tracks are original works inspired by the places they have been and the people they have met. 
The duo had their national American TV debut on Late Show with David Letterman on December 18, 2006, performing ""Diablo Rojo"". 

Their song ""Tamacun"" featured in the pilot episode of AMC's Breaking Bad in January 2008. 
Live in Japan was released on October 20, 2008, in the United Kingdom, and includes 14 tracks, and a bonus DVD containing five videos. The Led Zeppelin cover can be found on the album Rhythms del Mundo Classics. 
Their feature on MTV gave them a huge boost in popularity in the United States. This led to a feature on Nightmare Revisited, a tribute album to the music from Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas. The duo performed an instrumental version of ""Oogie Boogie's Song."" 
They released a new album, 11:11, in September, 2009. Alex Skolnick of Testament guests on the album, as do Strunz & Farah. Upon the release of the new album, they received much mainstream American popularity and were the featured music on Monday Night Football on October 12, 2009, as they celebrated Latino Heritage Month. 
Their song ""Santo Domingo"" was chosen as the Starbucks iTunes Pick of the Week for November 10, 2009. 
The duo was the musical guest on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson that aired on CBS-TV on October 28, 2009, and was re-run on December 29, 2009. They performed ""Buster Voodoo."" They performed on Jools Holland's Annual Hootenanny on December 31, 2009. 
The duo was the musical guest on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno that aired on NBC on March 23, 2010, to promote their album 11:11 and on Lopez Tonight which aired on TBS March 25, 2010. 

They headlined the West Holts stage on the Sunday night at Glastonbury 2010 and played the King Tuts Tent at T In The Park on 10 July 2010. They also had a spot on the main stage at Latitude festival that same July and they managed to draw in a huge crowd. 
In 2010, Rodrigo y Gabriela contributed a live version of their song ""Hora Zero"" to the Enough Project and Downtown Records' Raise Hope for Congo compilation. Proceeds from the compilation fund efforts to make the protection and empowerment of Congo's women a priority, as well as inspire individuals around the world to raise their voice for peace in the Congo. 
They played the Nice Jazz Festival on 23 July 2010, and the McMenamin's Edgefield outdoor concert in Portland, Oregon on August 14, 2010, as well as the Ravinia Festival on August 28, 2010, and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on September 30, 2010. 
In September, 2010, the duo announced a hiatus from touring due to stress injuries caused by Gabriela's heavily percussive style of playing. However, they did manage to play five sold-out nights at Shepherds Bush in London. 
On January 20, 2011, Rodrigo y Gabriela entered the studio with Hans Zimmer to write and record sessions of the score from Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. The soundtrack was released on May 17, 2011, three days before the film's general release. 
On July 9, 2011, Rodrigo Y Gabriela performed a live set for Guitar Center Sessions on DirecTV. The episode included an interview with program host, Nic Harcourt. On July 25, 2011, Rodrigo y Gabriela released another live album entitled Live in France. 
Rodrigo y Gabriela were featured in the 2011 DreamWorks film Puss in Boots, scored by Henry Jackman. 
During 2011, Rodrigo y Gabriela recorded in Havana, Cuba, with C.U.B.A., a 13-piece Cuban orchestra, and special guest musicians (Anoushka Shankar on sitar and Le Trio Joubran on oud). 
In January 2012 they released Area 52, their first album backed by other musicians. The tracks on the album are mostly re-worked versions of songs that have appeared on their duo albums, Rodrigo y Gabriela and 11:11. Reviews were mixed, with some tracks criticised for the backing band drowning out the guitar work that fans love but others praised where the guitar workouts ""are allowed space to breathe by lighter salsa-style backing."" 
In April 2014, Rodrigo y Gabriela released their fourth studio album, entitled 9 Dead Alive. 

Style:
Reviewing one of their gigs, The Independent noted that ""Rodrigo y Gabriela's secret is maybe quite simple. They are resourceful musicians, and are open-hearted, happy entertainers. That, very often, is what people want."" 
Both Rodrigo and Gabriela play Yamaha NX series electro nylon string guitars exclusively. Rodrigo plays the slimmer neck NTX1200 and Gabriela plays the more traditional sized NCX2000 and NCX1200. 

Personal lives:
Sánchez and Quintero dated for many years before ending their relationship (but not their musical partnership) in 2012. ""We're now better friends by far,"" said Quintero. ""We no longer behave like 15-year-olds and it's allowed us to grow up.""

Known as ""America's Band"", they are easily recognized by their complex vocal harmonies. Initially recording music that focused on Californian youth culture, halfway through the decade they shifted their attention towards melancholy orchestral pop, and continued to experiment with other genres. With the release of 1974's Endless Summer they became a more popular touring act, playing their greatest hits. They have recorded 36 Billboard Top 40 hits (including four number-one singles), have had over 100 million sales, and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988.  Formed in Hawthorne, California in 1961, the original group comprised singer-musician-composer Brian Wilson, his brothers Carl Wilson and Dennis Wilson, their cousin Mike Love, and friends Al Jardine and David Marks.  South African musicians Blondie Chaplin and Ricky Fataar played and sang with the band on three key albums during the early 1970s. Many changes in both musical style and personnel have occurred in their sometimes-stormy career: Brian Wilson's mental illness, drug addiction and eventual withdrawal from the group; the deaths of Dennis Wilson in 1983 and Carl Wilson in 1998; and continuing legal battles among surviving members of the group.  In December 2011, five of the group's surviving members - Brian, Mike, Al, Bruce and David (But not Blondie or Ricky) - reformed in celebration of their 50th anniversary, announcing that a new album and a 50-date international tour had been planned for 2012. The tour begun in on April 24, 2012 with a headlining performance at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival. Songfacts reports that the first single from the  album, That's Why God Made the Radio, made it's national radio debut on April 25, 2012 on ESPN's Mike and Mike in the Morning.  Early Years  The group was formed in 1961 in Hawthorne, California under the leadership of Brian Wilson, and included his brothers Carl and Dennis, their cousin Mike Love and school friend Al Jardine.  The early inspirations of the group were the Wilsons' musician father, Murry, and the close vocal harmonies of groups such as The Four Freshmen. The group performed initially as The Pendletones, after the Pendleton woolen shirts popular then. Although surfing motifs were very prominent in their early songs, Dennis was the sole actual surfer in the group. He suggested to his brothers that they do some songs celebrating his hobby and the lifestyle which had developed around it in Southern California.  At first Murry Wilson, by many accounts a hard-driving man, steered The Beach Boys' career, engineering their signing with Capitol Records in 1962. In 1964 Brian Wilson fired his father after a violent confrontation in the studio. Over the next few years they became increasingly estranged; when Murry died some years later, Brian and Dennis did not attend the funeral.  The Beach Boys' early material focused on the California youth lifestyle (e.g., ""All Summer Long"", ""Fun, Fun, Fun""), cars (""Little Deuce Coupe"") and of course surfing (""Surfin' U.S.A."", ""Surfin' Safari"" and many others). Although their music was bright and accessible, these early works contained remarkably sophisticated musical ideas. During this period, Brian Wilson rapidly progressed to become a melodist, arranger, and producer of world-renowned stature. Their early hits made them major pop stars in America and other countries, although their status as America's top pop group was challenged in 1964 by the emergence of The Beatles, who became The Beach Boys' major creative rival.  Like The Beatles, the Beach Boys showed very fast development during the mid-'60s, drawing upon the innovations of songwriters and producers such as Burt Bacharach and especially Phil Spector. They produced the enduring classic ""California Girls"" in 1965, a banner year for popular music which also saw similarly advanced singles by The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Byrds, and James Brown. But it was the Beach Boys' role to create a myth of American freedom and dreams of adolescence, and increasingly, to articulate a dread of what lay after adolescence.  Brian's innovations and personal difficulties  During 1964, Brian Wilson began to suffer from anxiety attacks, and withdrew from touring to concentrate on song writing and record production. Glen Campbell served as Wilson's replacement on tours, until his own career success required him to leave the group. Bruce Johnston was asked to locate a replacement for Campbell; having failed to find one, Johnston subsequently became a full-time member of the band, first replacing Wilson on the road, and then contributing his talents in the studio.  Wilson's growing mastery of the recording studio and his increasingly sophisticated songs and complex arrangements reached an early peak with the acclaimed LP Pet Sounds (1966). Classic singles from that album, ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"" and ""God Only Knows"" showed Wilson's growing skill as a composer, arranger and producer. ""God Only Knows"" is said to have been the first pop single ever released in the U.S. to have the word ""God"" in the title (because of which many radio stations in the U.S. refused to play it.) ""Caroline, No"" also taken from Pet Sounds, was issued as a Brian Wilson solo single, the only time Brian was credited as a solo artist during the early Capitol years.  The album's meticulously layered harmonies and inventive instrumentation (performed by the cream of Los Angeles session musicians known as The WRECKING CREW) set a new standard for popular music. It remains one of the more evocative releases of the decade, with a distinctive strain of melancholy and nostalgia for youth. The album is still widely regarded as a classic and Paul McCartney has named it one of his favorite albums of all time, (with ""God Only Knows"" as his favorite song) often saying that it was a major influence on The Beatles' album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Despite the critical praise it received, the album was poorly promoted by Capitol Records and failed to become the major hit Brian had hoped it would be (only reaching #10). Its failure to gain wide recognition hurt him deeply.  Because of his withdrawal from touring, Wilson was able to complete almost all the backing for the album while the Beach Boys were on tour in Japan. They returned to find a substantially complete album, requiring only their vocals to finish it off. There was some resistance from within the band to this new direction. Lead singer Mike Love is reported to have been strongly opposed to it, partly because he feared the band would lose its audience if they changed their successful formula, and partly because he personally disliked the new material, which he famously criticized as ""Brian's ego music."" At Love's insistence, Brian changed the title of one song from ""Hang on to Your Ego"" to ""I Know There's an Answer"". Another likely factor in Love's antipathy to Pet Sounds was that Wilson worked extensively on it with outside lyricist Tony Asher rather than with Love, even though Love had co-written the lyrics for many of their earlier songs and was the lead vocalist on most of their early hits. It should also be stated that Love, as recently as February 2008 in a top British music magazine, denies emphatically that he was opposed to Brian's new directions. Quite the contrary, contributing the lyrics to the classic form of ""Good Vibrations,"" which certainly seemed to usher in flower power. He really is tired of this view of him as being Brian's nemesis. He could see Brian was destroying himself and that was what he feared.  Seeking to expand on the advances made on Pet Sounds, Wilson began an even more ambitious project, originally dubbed Dumb Angel. Its first fruit was ""Good Vibrations,"" which Brian described as ""a pocket symphony"". The song became the Beach Boys' biggest hit to date, and a US and UK # 1 single in 1966 -- many critics consider it to be one of the best rock singles of all time. In 1997 it was named the ""Greatest Single of All Time"" by Mojo music magazine, in 2000, VH1 placed it at number 8 on their ""100 Greatest Rock Songs"" list, and in late 2004 Rolling Stone magazine placed it at number 6 on their ""500 Best Songs of All Time"" list. It was also one of the more complex pop productions ever undertaken, and was reputed to have been the most expensive American single ever recorded, costing a reported $16,000 -- more than most pop albums of that time -- with sessions stretching over several months in at least three major studios.  In contrast to his work on Pet Sounds, Wilson adopted a modular approach to ""Good Vibrations"" -- he broke the song into sections and taped multiple versions of each at different studios to take advantage of the different sound of each facility. He then assembled his favorite sections into a master backing track and added vocals. The song's innovative instrumentation included drums, organ, piano, tack piano, two basses, guitars, electro-theremin, harmonica, and cello. The group members recall the ""Good Vibrations"" vocal sessions as among the most demanding of their career.  Even as his personal life deteriorated, Wilson's musical output remained remarkable. The exact nature of his problems was a topic of much speculation. He abused drugs heavily, gained an enormous amount of weight, suffered long bouts of depression, and became paranoid. Several biographies have suggested that his father may have had bipolar disorder, and after years of suffering, Wilson's own condition was eventually diagnosed as schizophrenia.  The story behind ""Smile""  Shortly after completing ""Good Vibrations,"" Wilson met session musician and songwriter Van Dyke Parks, and in late 1966 they began an intense collaboration that resulted in a suite of superb new songs for the Beach Boys' next album, which was originally going to be titled Dumb Angel but was renamed Smile. Using the same methods as on ""Good Vibrations,"" recording began in late 1966 and carried on into early 1967. Although the structure of the album and the exact running order of the songs have been subjects of endless speculation, it is apparent that Wilson and Parks intended Smile to be a continuous suite of songs that were linked both thematically and musically, with the main songs being linked together by small vocal pieces and instrumental segments that elaborated the musical themes of the major songs.  But some of the other Beach Boys -- especially Love -- found the new music too difficult and too far removed from their established style; another serious concern was that the new music was simply not feasible for live performance by the current Beach Boys lineup. Love was bitterly opposed to Smile and was particularly critical of Parks' lyrics; he has also since stated that he was becoming deeply concerned about Wilson's escalating drug intake. The problems came to a head during the recording of ""Cabinessence,"" when Love demanded that Parks explain the meaning of the closing refrain of the song, ""Over and over the crow cries uncover the cornfield."" After a heated argument, Parks walked out and his partnership with Wilson came to an abrupt end.  Many factors combined to focus intense pressure on Wilson as Smile neared completion, including mental instability, the pressure to perform against fierce opposition to his new music, the relatively poor response to Pet Sounds, Carl Wilson's draft resistance, and a major dispute with Capitol. Matters were complicated by his reliance on both prescription and illegal drugs, particularly marijuana and amphetamines, which only exacerbated his underlying mental health problems.  Just weeks before The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band was released, Smile was shelved. Over the next 30 years the legends surrounding Smile grew, until it became the most famous unreleased album in the history of popular music. Some of the tracks were salvaged and rerecorded at Brian's new home studio in drastically scaled-down versions. These were released, along with the completed versions of ""Good Vibrations"" and ""Heroes and Villains"", on the 1967 LP Smiley Smile, which would prove to be a critical and commercial disaster for the group.  Despite the cancellation of Smile, interest in the work remained high and versions of several major tracks -- including ""Our Prayer"", ""Cabinessence"", ""Cool, Cool Water"", and ""Surf's Up"" -- were assembled by Carl Wilson over the next few years and included on later albums. The band was expecting to complete and release Smile even until 1972, when it became clear that only Brian would ever be able to make sense out of the endless fragments that were recorded. A substantial number of original tracks and linking fragments were included on the group's 30th anniversary CD boxed set in 1993. Smile itself, in its original conception, did not surface until Wilson and Parks completed the writing and Brian rerecorded it as a solo project in 2004.  Mid-career brings changes  Following their peak popularity with the song ""Good Vibrations"" was a period of declining commercial success, with Smiley Smile and subsequent albums doing poorly on the US charts (although they fared better in the UK). Their image problems were not helped by the criticism that followed their withdrawal from the bill of the 1967 Monterey International Pop Festival as a result of Carl's draft problems, an event that would undoubtedly have been crucial in establishing their new sound had they been able to present their new material there.  The 1967 album Wild Honey, regarded by many critics as a classic, features exuberant upbeat songs written by Brian and Mike, including the hit ""Darlin'"", and a cover of Stevie Wonder's ""I Was Made to Love Her"". Friends (1968) is a quiet, tuneful, and largely acoustic album, influenced by the group's adoption of the practice of transcendental meditation. The title single, however, backed by Dennis' songwriting debut Little Bird, was their least successful since 1962. This was followed by the single ""Do It Again"", a return to their earlier ""fun in the sun"" style, which was moderately successful in the US, but went to #1 in the UK.  As Brian's health deteriorated in the late 1960s and early 1970s, his song output diminished and he became increasingly withdrawn from the group. To fill the void, the other members of the group began writing songs, and Carl gradually took over leadership of the band, developing into an accomplished producer. To complete their contract with Capitol Records before signing with Reprise, they produced one more album, 20/20 (1969), primarily a collection of leftovers (including some from Smile), cover songs, and several new songs by Dennis. One of Denny's songs, ""Never Learn Not to Love"", featured lyrics by Charles Manson originally titled ""Cease to Exist"". Besides ""Do It Again"", the album included their cover of The Ronettes' ""I Can Hear Music"", their last top 40 hit for seven years.  Their first two Reprise LPs were Sunflower (1970) and 1971's Surf's Up, featuring new songs by Brian and all the group members, plus selections from the aborted Smile project. According to the liner notes for the 2004 version of Smile, Reprise expected the legendary album to be completed and released as part of the new contract, but this was never to be; however, these albums included some of their most evolved and complex music since the Smile period.  The addition of Ricky Fataar and Blondie Chaplin in 1972 led to a dramatic departure in sound for the band. Carl and the Passions - So Tough was an uncharacteristic mix including several songs unrecognizable as the Beach Boys. Although it includes the classic ""Marcella"", many consider the album among their poorest efforts. Continuing with Fataar and Chaplin, Holland (1973) was more successful. The album's lead single ""Sail On Sailor,"" a brief return to the collaboration between Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks, was one of the more emblematic of Beach Boys songs. Although it did not produce any top-40 hits, Holland was popular on free-form FM-radio, and includes several classics including Al Jardine's ""California Saga/California"".  In the summer of 1974 Capitol, in consultation with Love, released a double album compilation of the Beach Boys' pre-Pet Sounds hits, entitled Endless Summer. Helped by a sunny, colorful graphic cover, it caught the mood of the country and surged to #1 on the Billboard album chart, becoming their first gold record since ""Good Vibrations"", and stayed on the album chart for three years. The following year another compilation, Spirit of America, also did well. These sales performances demonstrated that the classic Beach Boys sound was back in fashion.  In 1975, the Beach Boys staged a highly successful joint concert tour with Chicago, with each group performing some of the other's songs, including their previous year's collaboration on Chicago's hit ""Wishing You Were Here"". Beach Boy voices were also heard on Elton John's 1974 hit ""Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me"", but following Holland, the group produced no new music until 1976.  Brian's return  15 Big Ones marked the return of Brian Wilson as a major force in the group. This album includes several new songs composed by Brian, and several of his arrangements of favorite old songs by other artists, including ""Rock and Roll Music"" (which made #5), ""Blueberry Hill"", and ""In The Still of The Night"". Brian and Mike's ""It's OK"" was a return to their earlier ""fun-in-the-sun"" style, and was a moderate hit.  In 1977 the Beach Boys released the LP Love You, a collection of 14 songs mostly written by Brian alone, including more ""fun"" songs (""Honkin' Down the Highway""), a mature love song (""Let's Put Our Hearts Together"") - a quirky mix ranging from infectious to touching to downright silly. Although not a commercial success, the album has since gained the status of a classic within the Beach Boys' oeuvre.  Brian's contributions diminished over the next several albums until he again virtually withdrew from the group. Although he appeared sporadically with them in concert, he contributed little to their performances or recordings. Despite a much-publicised ""Brian's Back"" campaign in the late '70s, most critics believed the group was past their prime. Many expected that Brian would one day become the latest in a long line of celebrity drug casualties.  Deaths of Dennis and Carl Wilson  In the late 70s Dennis Wilson also began to suffer increasingly from drug and alcohol abuse, and some of the group's concert appearances were marred when he and other band members showed up onstage drunk or drugged. The band was forced to publicly apologize after a shambolic performance in Sydney in 1979 during which several members of the group appeared to be drunk. In spite of his own frequent drinking, Dennis Wilson managed to release his first solo work, Pacific Ocean Blue, and to launch the now famed work-in-progress Bambu, with friend and musician Carli Muñoz.  In 1980, the Beach Boys played a Fourth of July concert on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. before a vast crowd. This tradition continued for the next two years, but in 1983 Secretary of the Interior James Watt banned the group from playing on the Mall, saying that rock concerts drew ""an undesirable element"". This drew howls of outrage from the many of the Beach Boys' American fans, who stated that the Beach Boys sound was a very desirable part of the American cultural fabric. First Lady Nancy Reagan apologized, and in 1985 the group appeared on the Mall again. The group most recently appeared on the Mall in 2005 for the Fourth of July concert.  Dennis Wilson's problems had escalated in the early 1980s, and he accidentally drowned in late 1983 while diving from his boat as he drunkenly tried to recover items he had previously thrown overboard. Despite Dennis's death, The Beach Boys soldiered on, and they enjoyed a resurgence of interest later in the 1980s, assisted by tributes such as the David Lee Roth version of ""California Girls"". In 1987, they played with the rap group The Fat Boys, covering the song ""Wipe Out"" and filming a video for it. They scored their first #1 in 22 years with the 1988 song ""Kokomo,"" which was featured on the soundtrack of the hit Tom Cruise movie Cocktail and which became their biggest-selling hit ever. In 1996 they guested with Status Quo on a re-recording of Fun, Fun, Fun, which was a British Top 30 hit.  Members of the band appeared on sitcoms such as Full House (starring sometimes drummer John Stamos) and Home Improvement in the 1990s, as well as touring occasionally, but their declining career contrasted dramatically with the massive public interest and rabid critical praise that followed Brian's gradual return to touring in the 1990s. The critically acclaimed documentary I Just Wasn't Made For These Times, important in restoring Wilson's reputation, saw him performing for the first time with his now adult daughters, Wendy and Carnie, and included glowing tributes to his talents from a host of major music stars of the '60s, '70s, and '80s.  Tragedy struck the Wilson family again in 1998 when Carl Wilson died of lung cancer. In 1997, while Carl was in the hospital fighting his cancer, David Marks rejoined the group, subbing for Carl. After Carl's death, Al Jardine was forced out of the group due to a conflict with Love. Brian Wilson was pursuing a solo career at the time, and had no desire to work with the Beach Boys. Permission was given to Mike Love to tour under the Beach Boys' name, and from 1998 to 2011, ""The Beach Boys"" consisted of Mike Love and Bruce Johnston. Marks toured with them from Carl's death until the summer of 1999, when he left the group due to health reasons. Their tours remained popular, even as they came to be viewed primarily as a nostalgia act. Meanwhile, Brian Wilson and Al Jardine each separately pursued solo careers with their new bands.  Setting aside differences  On June 13, 2006, the major surviving Beach Boys (Brian Wilson, Mike Love, Al Jardine, Bruce Johnston, and David Marks) all set aside their differences and reunited for a celebration of the 40th anniversary of the album Pet Sounds and the double-platinum certification of their greatest hits compilation, Sounds of Summer: The Very Best of the Beach Boys, in a ceremony atop the Capitol Records building in Hollywood. Plaques were awarded for their efforts to all major members, with Brian Wilson accepting for his late brothers Carl and Dennis.   Personnel changes through the years  From the start, The Beach Boys have undergone many variations in composition, being represented by fill-ins as often as not. Wilson neighbor David Marks appeared on their first four albums and was a member from 1962 to 1963 as a temporary replacement for Jardine, who had left the group to pursue a career in dentistry. Marks rejoined the band in 1997, during Carl Wilson's last illness, and remained with them for two years.  Glen Campbell toured for several months with the group in 1965, as a touring replacement for Brian, who had played bass in concert. Campbell was subsequently replaced by Bruce Johnston, who later became a permanent member. During the mid-1970s drummer Ricky Fataar and guitarist Blondie Chaplin joined the band.  Though not official members, The Beach Boys' supporting band has featured many notable musicians over the years. Keyboard player Daryl Dragon, later famous as half of the pop duo Captain & Tennille, toured with the band, along with his future wife Toni Tennille. Carli Muñoz, who had been playing percussion with the band since 1970, in 1971 replaced Daryl Dragon as keyboard player until 1981. Jeff Foskett joined the touring band in 1981 as a guitarist and vocalist and remained with the group until 1990, Foskett is currently a member of Brian Wilson's group. Billy Hinsche, of Dino, Desi, & Billy fame, was also a longtime member of the supporting band throughout the '70s, '80s, and '90s. Daryl Dragon's brother Dennis Dragon was a percussionist for the group in the early '70s. Bobby Figueroa was a drummer and percussionist for the Beach Boys in the 1970s and 80s. Mike Meros was a longtime keyboard player for the group, leaving in 2001 to join Alan Jardine's Endless Summer Band (Meros passed away in late 2007). Mike Kowalski was a longtime drummer for the band, starting his Beach Boys tenure in 1969, and continuing with the group throughout the '70s, '80s,' 90s, and '00s, only to leave in 2007. Ed Carter played guitar and bass for the group from 1969 through the late 1990s. Carter joined Al Jardine's Beach Boys Friends and Family in 1999.  Some of the changes in The Beach Boys' organization were less formal. They enjoyed a casual collaboration with fellow Southern Californians Jan And Dean. Much to the consternation of other band members, Wilson composed ""Surf City"" and gave the song, without compensation, to Dean Torrence. Jan and Dean, at the time not nearly as popular as The Beach Boys, recorded the song and scored their first number one single, long before the Beach Boys reached the same milestone. Years later, Torrence happened upon the studio where the Beach Boys were recording their ""Beach Boys' Party!"" album. He joined in the singing, and can be heard singing harmony in the ""Barbara Ann"" cut from that album.  After the death of Carl Wilson, Mike Love received permission from Brian Wilson, Al Jardine, and the estate of Carl Wilson to tour under the Beach Boys name. In 1998 and 1999, Mike Love, Bruce Johnston, and David Marks toured under this incarnation of the Beach Boys. In 1999, David Marks left so he could focus on fighting his Hepatitis C (He was fully cured in 2004.). From 1999 to 2011, Mike Love and Bruce Johnston have played up to 100 shows a year, sometimes more, under the Beach Boys banner.  To the surprise and delight of fans around the world, Brian Wilson has mounted several major tours under his own name with a band containing members of The Wondermints (Darian Sahanaja, Nick Walusko, and Probyn Gregory) and led by former Beach Boys guitarist Jeff Foskett plus other supporting musicians (Scott Bennett, Taylor Mills, Jim Hines, Paul Mertens, Nelson Bragg, Bob Lizik). Their note-perfect live performances of the entire Pet Sounds album earned some of the most glowing concert reviews of Wilson's career, with some commentators calling the shows ""the concert of a lifetime"". In 2003 and 2004, he and Van Dyke Parks reunited to complete the unfinished sections of Smile, and in 2004 Wilson and his band toured the world performing a live concert version of the album. They then recorded a new studio version of Smile using vintage recording equipment and including sessions at the fabled Sunset Sound Studios in Hollywood, where some of the original recordings were made.  In September of 2007, Wilson debuted a new work entitled That Lucky Old Sun, co-written with Van Dyke Parks and band member Scott Bennett, at the Royal Festival Hall in London. Wilson plans to record and release That Lucky Old Sun as a studio album in 2008.  Jardine toured for a while with the Beach Boys Family & Friends (which for legal reasons quickly became Alan Jardine Family & Friends Beach Band), featuring his sons Matt and Adam, Wilson's daughters Carnie and Wendy, former Beach Boys sidemen Ed Carter , Bobby Figueroa, and Carl's brother-in-law Billy Hinsche, among others. Jardine now tours as the Endless Summer Band which includes his two sons, Hinsche, and several other performers including members of the pop/rock band Tripsitter.  50th Anniversary  In December 2011, surviving members Brian Wilson, Mike Love, Al Jardine, David Marks, and Bruce Johnston reunited for a new studio album and an extensive 70-plus date ""50th Anniversary Celebration"" world tour. They used musicians from both Brian Wilson's solo band and Mike Love's touring ""Beach Boys"" as sidemen. The reunited Beach Boys played to enthusiastic crowds all over the world.   In 2012 Mike Love announced that he and Bruce Johnston had booked shows for their scaled down version of the Beach Boys. Wilson, Jardine, and Marks wanted to continue with the reunited line up, but for various reasons, Love did not.   In 2013, Mike Love and Bruce Johnston are continuing to tour under the Beach Boys name. Brian Wilson has been in the studio, it is not known whether the sessions are for the Beach Boys, or for Brian solo material. Brian Wilson also plans to play two shows with Al Jardine and David Marks, one show in Ohio, and the other at the Greek Theater in Los Angeles. A live album and/or DVD, and a career-spanning box set entitled ""Made In California"" are slated to be released sometime in 2013.

The group's original lineup consisted of brothers Brian, Dennis and Carl Wilson, their cousin Mike Love, and their friend Al Jardine. Emerging at the vanguard of the ""California Sound"", the band's early music gained international popularity for their distinct vocal harmonies and lyrics evoking a southern California youth culture of surfing, cars, and romance. Influenced by jazz-based vocal groups, 1950s rock and roll, and doo-wop, Brian led the band to experiment with several genres ranging from pop ballads to psychedelic and baroque while devising novel approaches to music production and arranging. While initially managed by the Wilsons' father Murry, Brian's creative ambitions and sophisticated songwriting abilities dominated the group's musical direction. 
Released in 1966, the Pet Sounds album and the ""Good Vibrations"" single featured an intricate and multi-layered sound that represented a departure from the simple surf rock of the Beach Boys' early years. Soon after the dissolution of Smile, Brian gradually ceded control to the rest of the band, reducing his input due to mental health and substance abuse issues. Though the more democratic incarnation of the Beach Boys recorded a string of albums in various musical styles that garnered international critical success, the group struggled to reclaim their commercial momentum in America. Since the 1980s, much-publicized legal wrangling over royalties, songwriting credits and use of the band's name transpired. Dennis drowned in 1983 and Carl died of lung cancer in 1998. After Carl's death, many live configurations of the band fronted by Mike Love and Bruce Johnston continued to tour into the 2000s while other members pursued solo projects. For the band's 50th anniversary, the surviving co-founders briefly reunited for a new studio album and world tour. 
The Beach Boys are often touted ""America's Band"", and AllMusic stated that their ""unerring ability...made them America's first, best rock band."" The group had over eighty songs chart worldwide, thirty-six of them United States Top 40 hits (the most by an American rock band), four reaching number-one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The Beach Boys have sold in excess of 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling bands of all time and are listed at number 12 on Rolling Stone magazine's 2004 list of the ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"". They have received one Grammy Award for The Smile Sessions (2011). The core quintet of the three Wilsons, Love and Jardine were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988. 

1958-66: Brian Wilson era:

Formation:

At the time of his sixteenth birthday on June 20, 1958, Brian Wilson shared a bedroom with his brothers, Dennis and Carl - aged thirteen and eleven, respectively - in their family home in Hawthorne. He had watched his father, Murry Wilson, play piano, and had listened intently to the harmonies of vocal groups such as the Four Freshmen. After dissecting songs such as ""Ivory Tower"" and ""Good News"", Brian would teach family members how to sing the background harmonies. For his birthday that year, Brian was given a reel-to-reel tape recorder. He learned how to overdub, using his vocals and those of Carl and their mother. Brian would play piano with Carl and David Marks, an eleven-year-old longtime neighbor, playing the guitars they had each received as Christmas presents. 
Soon Brian and Carl were avidly listening to Johnny Otis' KFOX radio show. Inspired by the simple structure and vocals of the rhythm and blues songs he heard, Brian changed his piano-playing style and started writing songs. His enthusiasm interfered with his music studies at school. Family gatherings brought the Wilsons in contact with cousin Mike Love. Brian taught Love's sister Maureen and a friend harmonies. Later, Brian, Mike Love and two friends performed at Hawthorne High School. Brian also knew Al Jardine, a high school classmate who had already played guitar in a folk group called the Islanders. Brian suggested to Jardine that they team up with his cousin and brother Carl. 
It was at these sessions, held in Brian's bedroom, that ""the Beach Boys sound"" began to form. Love encouraged Brian to write songs and gave the fledgling band its name: ""The Pendletones"", a portmanteau of ""Pendleton"", a style of woolen shirt popular at the time and ""tone"", the musical term. Although surfing motifs were very prominent in their early songs, Dennis was the only avid surfer in the group. He suggested that the group compose songs celebrating the sport and the lifestyle which had developed around it within Southern California. 

Jardine and a singer friend, Gary Winfrey, went to Brian to see if he could help out with a version of a folk song they wanted to record--""Sloop John B"". In Brian's absence, the two spoke with their father, a music industry veteran of modest success. Murry arranged for the Pendletones to meet his publisher, Hite Morgan. The group performed a slower ballad, ""Their Hearts Were Full of Spring"", but failed to impress Morgan. After an awkward pause, Dennis mentioned they had an original song, ""Surfin'"". Brian finished the song, and together with Mike Love, wrote ""Surfin' Safari"". The group rented guitars, drums, amplifiers and microphones, and practiced for three days while the Wilsons' parents were on a short vacation. 
In October 1961, the Pendletones recorded the two surfing song demos in twelve takes at Keen Recording Studio. Murry brought the demos to Herb Newman, owner of Candix Records and Era Records, and he signed the group on December 8, 1961. When the boys eagerly unpacked the first box of singles - released both under the Candix label, and also as a promo issue under X Records (Morgan's label) - they were shocked to see their band had been renamed as the Beach Boys. Murry Wilson called Morgan and learned that Candix wanted to name the group the Surfers to directly associate them with the increasingly popular teen sport. But Russ Regan, a young promoter with Era Records - who later became president of 20th Century Fox Records - noted that there already existed a group by that name, and he suggested calling them the Beach Boys. 

Beach-themed period:

Released in December 1961, ""Surfin'"" was soon aired on KFWB and KRLA, two of Los Angeles' most influential teen radio stations. It was a hit on the West Coast, going to number three in Southern California, and peaked at number 75 on the national pop charts. By the final weeks of 1961 ""Surfin'"" had sold more than 40,000 copies. By now the de facto manager of the Beach Boys, he landed the group's first paying gig (for which they earned $300) on New Year's Eve, 1961, at the Ritchie Valens Memorial Dance in Long Beach, headlined by Ike & Tina Turner. In their earliest public appearances, the band wore heavy wool jacket-like shirts which were favored by local surfers before switching to their trademark striped shirts and white pants 
Although Murry effectively seized managerial control of the band, Brian acknowledged that he ""deserves credit for getting us off the ground... he hounded us mercilessly... but also worked hard himself"". In the first half of February 1962, Jardine left the band and was replaced by Marks. The band recorded two more originals on April 19 at Western Studios, Los Angeles; ""Lonely Sea"" and ""409"", also re-recording ""Surfin' Safari"". On June 4, the band released their second single ""Surfin' Safari"" backed with ""409"". The release prompted national coverage in the June 9 issue of Billboard where the magazine praised Love's lead vocal and deemed the song to have strong hit potential. After being turned down by Dot and Liberty, the Beach Boys eventually signed a seven-year contract with Capitol Records on July 16 based on the strength of the June demo session. This was at the urging of Capitol exec Nik Venet who signed the group, finding them to be the ""teenage gold"" he had been scouting. By November, their first album was ready--Surfin' Safari which reached 32 on the US Billboard charts. Their song output continued along the same commercial line, focusing on California youth lifestyle. 
In January 1963, three months after the release of their debut album, the band began recording their sophomore effort, Surfin' U.S.A., a breakthrough for Brian, who began asserting himself as songwriter and arranger. The LP was the start of Brian's penchant for doubletracking vocals, a pioneering innovation which provided the Beach Boys with an exceptionally bright sound. Released on March 25, 1963, Surfin' U.S.A., met a more enthusiastic reception, reaching number two on the Billboard charts, propelling the band into a nationwide spotlight, and was vital to launching surf music as a national craze. Five days prior to the release of Surfin' U.S.A., Brian produced ""Surf City"", a song he had written for Jan and Dean. ""Surf City"" hit number one on the Billboard charts in July 1963, a development that pleased Brian but angered Murry, who felt his son had ""given away"" what should have been the Beach Boys' first chart-topper. 
At the beginning of a tour of the Mid-West in April 1963, Jardine rejoined the Beach Boys at Brian's request. As he began playing live gigs again, Brian left the road to focus on writing and recording. The result of this arrangement produced the albums Surfer Girl, released on September 16, 1963 and Little Deuce Coupe, released less than a month later on October 7, 1963. This sextet incarnation of the Beach Boys did not extend beyond these two albums, as Marks officially left the band in early October due to conflict with manager Murry, pulling Brian back into touring. 
Around this time, Brian began using members of the Wrecking Crew to augment his increasingly demanding studio arrangements. Session musicians that participated on Wilson's productions were said to have been awestruck by his musical abilities, as drummer Hal Blaine explained, ""We all studied in conservatories; we were trained musicians. We thought it was a fluke at first, but then we realized Brian was writing these incredible songs. This was not just a young kid writing about high school and surfing."" For composer Frank Zappa, the most exciting thing to him in ""white-person-music"" was when the Beach Boys used the progression V-II on ""Little Deuce Coupe"", calling it ""an important step forward by going backward."" A standalone Christmas-themed single, ""Little Saint Nick"", was released in December 1963, backed with an a capella rendition of the scriptural song ""The Lord's Prayer"". The A-side peaked at number 3 on the US Billboard Christmas chart. 
Following a successful Australasian tour in January and February 1964, the band returned home to face the British Invasion through the Beatles appearances on the Ed Sullivan Show. Signed to the same label as the Beach Boys, Capitol immediately began waning their support for the group, causing Murry to fight proactively for the band at the label more than before, often showing up to their offices in person without a call in advance in order to ""twist executive arms"". Brian reacted to the Beatles with pronounced bemusement: ""I was flipping out. I couldn't understand how a group could be just yelled and screamed at. The music they made, 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' for example, wasn't even that great a record, but they just screamed at it. ... It got us off our asses in the studio. We started cutting - we said 'look, don't worry about the Beatles, we'll cut our own stuff."" Reportedly, Brian wanted more time to complete their next album, yet Capitol insisted they finish recording swiftly to avoid being forgotten in the throes of the impending invasion. Satisfying these demands, the band hastily finished the sessions on February 20, 1964 and titled the album Shut Down Volume 2. ""Fun, Fun, Fun"" was released as a single from the album (backed with ""Why Do Fools Fall in Love"") and was a major hit. The LP, while containing several filler tracks, was propelled by other songs such as the melancholic ""The Warmth of the Sun"" and the advanced production style of ""Don't Worry Baby"". 
Brian soon wrote his last surf song in April 1964. That month, during recording of the single ""I Get Around"", Murry was relieved of his duties as manager. Brian reflected, ""We love the family thing - y'know: three brothers, a cousin and a friend is a really beautiful way to have a group - but the extra generation can become a hang-up"". When the single was released in May of that year, it would climb to number one, their first single to do so. Two months later, the album that the song later appeared on, All Summer Long, reached number four on the Billboard 200 charts. All Summer Long introduced exotic textures to the Beach Boys' sound exemplified by the piccolos and xylophones of its title track. The album was a swan-song to the surf and car music the Beach Boys built their commercial standing upon. Later albums took a different stylistic and lyrical path. Before this, a live album, Beach Boys Concert, was released in October to a four-week chart stay at number one, containing a setlist of previously recorded hits and covers that they hadn't yet recorded. 

Today! and Summer Days:
In June 1964, Brian began recording the bulk of The Beach Boys' Christmas Album with a forty-one-piece studio orchestra in collaboration with Four Freshmen arranger Dick Reynolds. Released in December, it was divided between five new, original Christmas-themed songs and seven reinterpretations of traditional Christmas songs. One single from the album, ""The Man with All the Toys"", was released, peaking at number 6 on the US Billboard Christmas chart. On October 29, the Beach Boys performed for The T.A.M.I. Show, a concert film intended to bring together a wide range of hit-making musicians for a one-off performance. The result was released to movie theaters one month later. 
By the end of the year, the stress of road travel, composing, producing and maintaining a high level of creativity became too much for Brian. On December 23, while on a flight from Los Angeles to Houston, he suffered a panic attack only hours after performing with the Beach Boys on the musical variety series Shindig!. In January 1965, he announced his withdrawal from touring to concentrate entirely on songwriting and record production. For the rest of 1964 and into 1965, Glen Campbell served as Wilson's temporary replacement in concert, until his own career success pulled him from the group in April 1965. Bruce Johnston was asked to locate a replacement for Campbell; having failed to find one, Johnston himself became a full-time member of the band on May 19, 1965, first replacing Brian on the road and later contributing in the studio, beginning with the vocal sessions for ""California Girls"" on June 4, 1965. 

After Brian relinquished touring in 1965, he became a full-time studio artist, showcasing a great leap forward with The Beach Boys Today!, an album containing a suite-like structure divided by songs and ballads which portended the Album Era with its cohesive artistic statement. During the recording sessions for Today!, Love told Melody Maker that he and the band wanted to look beyond surf rock and to avoid living in the past or resting on their laurels. The resulting LP had largely guitar-oriented pop songs such as ""Dance, Dance, Dance"" and ""Good to My Baby"" on side A with B-side ballads such as ""Please Let Me Wonder"" and ""She Knows Me Too Well"". 
Today! marked a maturation in the Beach Boys' lyric content by abandoning themes related to surfing, cars, or teenage love. Some love songs remained, but with a marked increase in depth, along with introspective tracks accompanied by adventurous and distinct arrangements. While the band's contemporaries grew more intellectually aware, Capitol continued to bill them as ""America's Top Surfin' Group!"", expecting Brian to write more surfing material for the yearly summer markets despite his disinterest. 
In June 1965, the band released Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!). The album included a reworked arrangement of ""Help Me, Rhonda"" which had become the band's second number one single in the spring of 1965, displacing the Beatles' ""Ticket to Ride"". ""Let Him Run Wild"" tapped into the youthful angst that would later pervade their music. In November 1965, the group followed up their US number-three-charting ""California Girls"" from Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!) with another top-twenty single, ""The Little Girl I Once Knew"". It was considered the band's most experimental statement thus far, using silence as a pre-chorus, clashing keyboards, moody brass and vocal tics. The single continued Brian's ambitions for daring arrangements, featuring unexpected tempo changes and numerous false endings. Perhaps too extreme an arrangement to go much higher than its number 20 peak, it was the band's second single not to reach the top ten since their 1962 breakthrough. 
Capitol demanded a Beach Boys LP for the 1965 Christmas season, and to appease them, Brian conceived Beach Boys' Party!, a live-in-the-studio album consisting mostly of acoustic covers of 1950s rock and R&B songs, in addition to covers of three Beatles songs, Bob Dylan's ""The Times They Are a-Changin'"", and idiosyncratic rerecordings of the group's earlier hits. In December they scored an unexpected number two hit (number three in the UK) with ""Barbara Ann"", which Capitol released as a single with no band input. Originally by the Regents, it became one of the Beach Boys' most recognized hits. 

Pet Sounds:

In 1966, the Beach Boys formally established their use of unconventional instruments and elaborate layers of vocal harmonies on their groundbreaking record Pet Sounds. It is considered Brian's most concise demonstration of his production and songwriting expertise. With songs such as ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"" and ""Sloop John B"", the album's innovative soundscape incorporates elements of pop, jazz, classical, exotica, and the avant-garde. The instrumentation combines found sounds such as bicycle bells and dog whistles with classically inspired orchestrations and the usual rock set-up of drums and guitars; among others, silverware, accordions, plucked piano strings, barking dogs, and plastic water jugs. For the basic rhythmic feel for ""God Only Knows"", harpsichord, piano with slapback echo, sleigh bells, and strings spilled into each other to create a rich blanket of sound. 
Pet Sounds is considered by some as a Brian Wilson solo album in all but name, as other members contributed relatively little to the compositions or recordings. Influenced by psychedelic drugs, Brian turned inward and probed his deep-seated self-doubts and emotional longings; the piece did not address the problems in the world around them, unlike other psychedelic rock groups. As Jim Miller wrote of the album's tone, ""It vented Wilson's obsession with isolation cataloging a forlorn quest for security. The whole enterprise, which smacked of song cycle pretensions, was streaked with regret and romantic langour."" According to Brian, the album was designed as a collection of art pieces which belong together yet could stand alone. 
Released in May, Pet Sounds eventually peaked at number eleven in the US and number two in the UK, an accomplishment which helped the Beach Boys become the strongest selling album act in the UK for the final quarter of 1966, dethroning the three-year reign of native bands such as the Beatles. Met with a lukewarm critical reception in the US,Pet Sounds was indifferently promoted by Capitol and failed to become the major hit Wilson had hoped it would be. Its failure to gain a wider recognition in the US combined with Capitol's decision to issue Best of The Beach Boys in July dispirited Brian, who considered Pet Sounds an extremely personal work. It was assumed that the label considered the album a risk, appealing more to an older demographic than the younger, female audience the Beach Boys built their commercial standing on.Pet Sounds sales numbered approximately 500,000 units, a significant drop-off from the chain of million-selling albums which immediately preceded it.Best of The Beach Boys was quickly certified Gold by the RIAA. 
In a 1972 review of Pet Sounds, music journalist Stephen Davis wrote, 

From first cut to last we were treated to an intense, linear personal vision of the vagaries of a love affair and the painful, introverted anxieties that are the wrenching precipitates of the unstable chemistry of any love relationship. This trenchant cycle of love songs has the emotional impact of a shatteringly evocative novel, and by God if this little record didn't change only the course of popular music, but the course of a few lives in the bargain. ... nobody was prepared for anything so soulful, so lovely, something one had to think about so much. 

Pet Sounds went on to be acknowledged as an important historical and cultural work, remaining today as an evocative release with distinctive lushness and melancholy. Beyond pop and rock, Pet Sounds expanded the field of music production. It was massively influential upon its release, vaunting the band to the top level of rock innovators. It is one of the earliest rock concept albums, one of the earliest concept albums of the counterculture era, and an early album in the emerging psychedelic rock style, signaling a turning point wherein rock, which previously had been considered dance music, became music that was made for listening to. 
In The Album: A Guide to Pop Music's Most Provocative, Influential, and Important Creations, author James Perone championed the album for its complex orchestrations, sophisticated compositions, and varied tone colors, calling it a remove from ""just about anything else that was going on in 1966 pop music."" In 1976, journalist Robin Denselow wrote: ""With the 1966 Pet Sounds album ... Wilson had become America's equivalent of the Beatles with his ability to expand the limits of popular taste.""Paul McCartney named it one of his favorite albums of all time on multiple occasions, calling it the primary impetus for the Beatles' album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967). In 2003, Pet Sounds was ranked second in ""The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time"" list selected by Rolling Stone, behind only Sgt. Pepper. 

""Good Vibrations"" and Smile:
Seeking to expand on Pet Sounds' advances, Wilson began an even more ambitious project: ""Good Vibrations"". Like Pet Sounds, Brian opted for an eclectic array of instruments rarely heard in pop music. Described by Brian as a ""pocket symphony,"" it contains a mixture of classical, rock, and exotic instruments structured around a cut-up mosaic of musical sections represented by several discordant key and modal shifts. It became the Beach Boys' biggest hit to date, and a US and UK number one single in 1966. Coming at a time when pop singles were usually made in under two hours, it was one of the most complex pop productions ever undertaken, and the most expensive single ever recorded to that point. The production costs were estimated between $50,000 and $75,000 ($360,000 and $550,000 today) with sessions for the song stretching over several months in at least four major studios. According to Domenic Priore, the making of ""Good Vibrations"" was unlike anything previous in the realms of classical, jazz, international, soundtrack, or any other kind of recording. 
The single was an unequivocal milestone in studio productions, and continued in establishing Brian as an extender of popular tastes. To the counterculture of the 1960s, ""Good Vibrations"" served as an anthem. Rock critic Gene Sculatti prophesied in 1968, ""It may yet prove to be the most significantly revolutionary piece of the current rock renaissance."" Its instrumentation included the Tannerin, an easier-to-manipulate version of a theremin, which helped the Beach Boys claim a new hippie audience. Upon release, the single prompted an unexpected revival in theremins while increasing awareness of analog synthesizers, leading Moog Music to produce their own brand of ribbon-controlled instruments. Reflecting on this period in 1971, Cue magazine wrote: ""In the year and a half that followed Pet Sounds, the Beach Boys were among the vanguard in practically every aspect of the counter culture - psychedelia, art rock, a return to roots, ecology, organic food, the cooled-out sound - anticipating changes that rock didn't accomplish until 1969-1970."" 
The group established a short-lived film production company, called Home Movies, during this time. It was supposed to have created live action film and television properties starring the Beach Boys. However, the company completed only one music video, for ""Good Vibrations"", though various other psychedelic sequences and segments exist. 

I'm doing the spiritual sound, a white spiritual sound. Religious music...That's the whole movement...That's where I'm going and it's going to scare a lot of people when I get there. 

--Brian Wilson quoted in Goodbye Surfing, Hello God! (1967), by Jules Siegel

Brian met musician and songwriter Van Dyke Parks while working on Pet Sounds. A year later, while in the midst of recording ""Good Vibrations"", the duo began an intense collaboration that resulted in a suite of challenging new songs for the Beach Boys‍ '​ forthcoming album Smile, intended to surpass Pet Sounds. Recording for the album spanned about a year, from 1966 to 1967. It is known that Wilson and Parks intended Smile to be a continuous suite of songs that were linked both thematically and musically, with the main songs being linked together by small vocal pieces and instrumental segments that elaborated upon the musical themes of the major songs. Surviving recordings have shown that the music incorporated chanting, cowboy songs, explorations in Indian and Hawaiian music, jazz, tone poems with classical elements, cartoon sound effects, musique concrète, and yodeling. 
Parks has stated: he and Brian were conscious of the counterculture, and the two had felt estranged from it, but it was necessary to adhere to due to a willingness to ""get out of the Eisenhower mindset."" Parks stresses, ""At the same time, he didn't want to lose that kind of gauche sensibility that he had. He was doing stuff that nobody would dream of doing,"" citing an instance when Brian instructed a banjo player to play only one string, a ""gauche"" style of playing that ""just wasn't done"". 
Smile would go on to become the most legendary unreleased album in the history of popular music. In the decades following its non-release, it became the subject of intense speculation and mystique. Many believe that, had the album been released, it would have substantially altered the group's direction and established them at the vanguard of rock innovators. Writing about the album for the 33⅓ book series, Luis Sanchez stated: ""If Brian Wilson and The Beach Boys were going to survive as the defining force of American pop music they were, Smile was a conscious attempt to rediscover the impulses and ideas that power American consciousness from the inside out. It was a collaboration that led to some incredible music, which, if it had been completed as an album and delivered to the public in 1966, might have had an incredible impact."" 
Many factors combined to put intense pressure on Brian Wilson as Smile neared completion: his mental instability, the pressure to create despite fierce internal opposition to his new music, the relatively unenthusiastic response to Pet Sounds in the United States, Carl Wilson's draft resistance, and a major dispute with Capitol Records. Furthermore, Wilson's reliance on both prescription drugs and amphetamines exacerbated his underlying mental health problems. Comparable to Brian Jones and Syd Barrett, Brian Wilson's use of psychedelic drugs--especially LSD--led to a nervous breakdown in the late-1960s. As his legend grew, the Smile period came to be seen as the pivotal episode in his decline, and he became tagged as one of the most notorious celebrity drug casualties of the rock era. 

1967-77: the Beach Boys as a democratic unit:

Smiley Smile and Wild Honey:
Some Smile tracks were salvaged and re-recorded in scaled-down versions at Brian's new home studio. Along with the single version of ""Good Vibrations"", these tracks were released on Smiley Smile, an album which elicited positive critical and commercial response abroad, but was the first real commercial failure for the group in the United States. By this time the Beach Boys' management (Nick Grillo and David Anderle) had created the band's own record label, Brother. One of the first labels to be owned by a rock group, Brother Records was intended for releases of Beach Boys side projects, and as an invitation to new talent. The initial output of the label, however, was limited to Smiley Smile and two resulting singles from the album; the failure of ""Gettin' Hungry"" caused the band to shelve Brother until 1970. Despite the cancellation of Smile, several tracks--including ""Our Prayer"", ""Cabin Essence"" and ""Surf's Up""--continued to trickle out in later albums often as filler songs to offset Brian's unwillingness to contribute. The band was still expecting to complete and release Smile as late as 1973 before it became clear that only Brian could comprehend the endless fragments that had been recorded.Smiley Smile was followed up three months later with Wild Honey, featuring songs written by Wilson and Love, including the hit ""Darlin'"" and a rendition of Stevie Wonder's ""I Was Made to Love Her"". The album fared better than its predecessor, reaching number 24 in the US. 

By 1967, the Beach Boys had become cultural dinosaurs. And it happened almost overnight....Monterey was a gathering place for the ""far out"" sounds of the ""new"" rock, and the Beach Boys in concert really had no exotic sounds to display. The net result of all their internal and external turmoil was that the Beach Boys didn't go...and it is thought that this non-appearance was what really turned the ""underground"" tide against them. 

--David Leaf

Compounding the group's recent setbacks, their public image took a cataclysmic hit following their withdrawal from the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival for the reason that they had no new material to play while their forthcoming single and album lay in limbo. Their cancellation was seen as ""a damning admission that they were washed up and unable to compete with the 'new music'"". This notion was exacerbated by Rolling Stone writer Jann Wenner, who in contemporary publications criticized Brian Wilson for his oft-repeated ""genius"" label which he called a ""promotional shuck"" and an attempt to compare with the Beatles. However, Wenner later responded to their Wild Honey album with more optimism, remarking two months later that ""in any case it's good to see that the Beach Boys are getting their heads straight once again"". 
While being interviewed in August 1967 for the failed live album Lei'd in Hawaii, Brian admitted: ""I think rock n' roll-the pop scene-is happening. It's great. But I think basically, the Beach Boys are squares. We're not happening."" Former band publicist Derek Taylor later recalled a conversation with Brian and Dennis where they denied that the group had ever written surf music or songs about cars, and that the Beach Boys had never been involved with the surf and hot rod fads, as Taylor claimed, ""...they would not concede."" As a result of their initial target demographic and subsequent failures to blend with the hippie movement, the group was viewed as unhip relics, even though they had once been, as biographer Peter Ames Carlin wrote, ""the absolute center of the American rock 'n' roll scene,"" a time when they had ushered the psychedelic era. In early 1969, Brian proposed that the group change their name from ""the Beach Boys"" to ""the Beach"", reasoning for the simple fact that the band members were now grown men. Going to the effort of acquiring a contract which would declare a five-way agreement to officially rename the group, Stephen Desper reported, ""They all just kind of shrugged and said, 'Aw, come on, Brian, we don't wanna do that. That's how the public knows us, man. And that was it. He put the paper on the piano and it stayed there until I picked it up and took it away."" 

Friends and 20/20:

After meeting Maharishi Mahesh Yogi at a UNICEF Variety Gala in Paris, France on December 15, 1967, Love, along with other high-profile celebrities such as Donovan and the Beatles traveled to Rishikesh in India during February and March 1968. The following Beach Boys album Friends (1968) had songs influenced by the Transcendental Meditation taught by the Maharishi. The album reached number 13 in the UK and 126 in the US, the title track placing at number 25 in the UK and number 47 in the US, the band's lowest singles peak since 1962. In support of the Friends album, Love had arranged for the Beach Boys to tour with the Maharishi in the US, which has been called ""one of the more bizarre entertainments of the era"". Starting on May 3, 1968, the tour lasted five shows and was cancelled when the Maharishi had to withdraw to fulfill film contracts. Due to disappointing audience numbers and the Maharishi's withdrawal, twenty-four tour dates were subsequently cancelled at a cost estimated at US$250,000 (approximately US$1,610,000 today) for the band. This tour was followed by the release of ""Do It Again"", a single which critics described as an update of the Beach Boys' surf rock past in a late-1960's style. The single went to the top of the Australian and UK single charts in 1968 and was moderately successful in the US, peaking at number 20. 
For a short time in mid-1968, Brian Wilson sought psychological treatment in hospital. During his absence, other members began writing and producing material themselves. To complete their contract with Capitol, they produced one more album. 20/20 (1969) was one of the group's most stylistically diverse albums, including hard rock songs such as ""All I Want to Do"", the waltz-based ""Time to Get Alone"" and a remake of the Ronettes' ""I Can Hear Music"". The diversity of genres have been described as an indicator that the group was trying to establish an updated identity. The album performed strongly in the UK, reaching number three on the charts. In the US, the album reached a modest 68. 
In spring 1968, Dennis began a strained relationship with musician Charles Manson which persisted for several months afterward. Dennis bought him time at Brian's home studio where recording sessions were attempted while Brian stayed in his room. It was then proposed by Dennis that Manson be signed to Brother Records, though Brian reportedly disliked Charlie, and so a deal was never made. Without Manson's involvement, the Beach Boys did record one song penned by Manson: ""Cease to Exist"" rewritten as ""Never Learn Not To Love"". The idea of the Beach Boys recording one of his songs reportedly thrilled Manson, and it was released as a Beach Boys single. After accruing a large monetary debt to the group, Dennis deliberately omitted Manson's credit on its release while also altering the song's arrangement and lyrics. This greatly angered Manson. Growing fearful, Dennis gradually distanced himself from Manson, whose family had taken over his home. He was eventually convicted for murder conspiracy; from there on, Dennis was too afraid of the Manson family to ever speak publicly on his relationship, let alone testify against him. 
On April 12, 1969, the band revisited their 1967 lawsuit against Capitol Records after they alleged an audit undertaken revealed the band were owed over US$2,000,000 (US$12,860,000 today) for unpaid royalties and production duties. The band's contract with Capitol Records expired on June 30, 1969, after which Capitol Records deleted the Beach Boys' catalog from print, effectively cutting off their royalty flow. In November 1969, Murry Wilson sold Sea of Tunes, the Beach Boys' catalogue, to Irving Almo Music, a decision which according to Marilyn Wilson ""devastated Brian"". In late 1969, the Beach Boys reactivated their Brother label and signed with Reprise. Around this time, the band commenced recording for a new album. At the time the Beach Boys tenure ended with Capitol in 1969, they had sold 65 million records worldwide, closing the decade as the most commercially successful American group in popular music. 

Sunflower, Surf's Up, ""So Tough"", and Holland:

In 1970, armed with the new Reprise contract, the band appeared rejuvenated, releasing the album Sunflower to critical acclaim in the UK but indifference in the US. The album features a strong group presence with significant writing contributions from all band members. Brian was active during this period, writing or co-writing seven of the twelve songs on Sunflower and performing at half of the band's domestic concerts in 1970. Sunflower reached number 29 in the UK and number 151 in the US, the band's lowest domestic chart showing to that point. A version of ""Cottonfields"" arranged by Al Jardine appeared on European releases of Sunflower and as a single, reached number one in Australia, Norway, South Africa and Sweden and the top-five in six other countries, including the UK. 
After Sunflower, the band hired Jack Rieley as their manager. Under Rieley's management, the group's music began emphasizing political and social awareness. During this time, Carl Wilson gradually assumed leadership of the band and Rieley contributed lyrics. On August 30, 1971 the band released Surf's Up, named after the Brian Wilson/Van Dyke Parks composition ""Surf's Up"". The album was moderately successful, reaching the US top 30, a marked improvement over their recent releases. While the record charted, the Beach Boys added to their renewed fame by performing a near-sellout set at Carnegie Hall, followed by an appearance with the Grateful Dead at Fillmore East on April 27, 1971. The live shows during this era included reworked arrangements of many of the band's previous songs. A large portion of their set lists culled from Pet Sounds and Smile, as author Domenic Priore observes, ""They basically played what they could have played at the Monterey Pop Festival in the summer of 1967."" 

Johnston ended his first stint with the band shortly after Surf's Up's release, reportedly because of friction with Rieley. At Carl's suggestion, the addition of Ricky Fataar and Blondie Chaplin in February 1972 led to a dramatic restructuring in the band's sound. The album Carl and the Passions - ""So Tough"" was an uncharacteristic mix that included two songs written by Fataar and Chaplin. 
For their next project the band, their families, assorted associates and technicians moved to the Netherlands for the summer of 1972. They rented a farmhouse to convert into a makeshift studio where recording sessions for the new project would take place. By the end of their sessions, the band felt they had produced one of their strongest efforts yet. Reprise, however, felt that the album required a strong single. This resulted in the song ""Sail On, Sailor"", a collaboration between Brian Wilson, Tandyn Almer, Ray Kennedy, Jack Rieley and Van Dyke Parks featuring a soulful lead vocal by Chaplin. Reprise subsequently approved and the resulting album, Holland, was released early in 1973, peaking at number 37. Brian's musical children story, Mount Vernon and Fairway (A Fairy Tale), narrated by Rieley and strongly influenced by Randy Newman's Sail Away (1972), was included as a bonus EP. Despite indifference from Reprise, the band's concert audience started to grow. 
The Beach Boys in Concert, a double album documenting the 1972 and 1973 US tours, was another top-30 album and became the band's first gold record under Reprise. During this period the band established itself as one of America's most popular live acts. Chaplin and Fataar helped organize the concerts to obtain a high quality live performance, playing material off Surf's Up, Carl and the Passions and Holland and adding songs from their older catalog. This concert arrangement lifted them back into American public prominence. In late 1973, the 41-song soundtrack to American Graffiti was released including the band's early songs ""Surfin' Safari"" and ""All Summer Long"". The album was a catalyst in creating a wave of nostalgia that reintroduced the Beach Boys into contemporary American consciousness. In 1974, Capitol Records issued Endless Summer, the band's first major pre-Pet Sounds greatest hits package. The compilation surged to the top of the Billboard album charts and was the group's first multi-million selling record since ""Good Vibrations"". It remained on the charts for two years. Capitol followed with a second compilation, Spirit of America, which also sold well. With these compilations, the Beach Boys became one of the most popular acts in rock, propelling themselves from opening for Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young to headliners selling out basketball arenas in a matter of weeks.Rolling Stone named the Beach Boys the ""Band of the Year"" for 1974, solely on the basis of their juggernaut touring schedule and material written over a decade earlier. 
Rieley, who remained in the Netherlands after Holland‍ '​s release, was relieved of his managerial duties in late 1973. Chaplin also left in late 1973 after an argument with Steve Love, the band's business manager (and Mike's brother). Fataar remained until 1974, when he was offered a chance to join a new group led by future Eagles member Joe Walsh. Chaplin's replacement, James William Guercio, started offering the group career advice that resulted in his becoming their new manager. Under Guercio, the Beach Boys staged a highly successful 1975 joint concert tour with Chicago, with each group performing some of the other's songs, including their previous year's collaboration on Chicago's hit ""Wishing You Were Here"". Beach Boys vocals were also heard on Elton John's 1974 hit ""Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me"". Nostalgia had settled into the Beach Boys' hype; the group had not officially released any new material since 1973's Holland. While their concerts continuously sold out, the stage act slowly changed from a contemporary presentation followed by oldies encores to an entire show made up of mostly pre-1967 music. 

15 Big Ones and Love You:

Recorded in the wake of California Music's demise, a supergroup which would have involved Brian Wilson, Bruce Johnston, and record producer Terry Melcher,15 Big Ones (1976) marked Brian's return as a major force in the group. The album included new songs by Brian, as well as cover versions of oldies such as ""Rock and Roll Music"", ""Blueberry Hill"", and ""In the Still of the Night"". ""Rock and Roll Music"" peaked at number 5 in the US. Brian and Love's ""It's O.K."" was in the vein of their early sixties style and was a moderate hit. The album was publicized by an August 1976 NBC-TV special, simply titled ""The Beach Boys"". The special, produced by Saturday Night Live (SNL) creator Lorne Michaels, featured appearances by SNL cast members John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd. 

The album was generally disliked by fans and critics upon release. During its sessions, Brian's production role was belittled as group members overdubbed and remixed tracks to fight against his desire for a rough, unfinished sound. Carl and Dennis disparaged the album to the press while Brian admitted ""undoubtedly the new album is nothing too deep,"" but remained hopeful that their next release would be on par with the group's ""Good Vibrations"". 
For the remainder of 1976 to early 1977, Brian spent his time making sporadic public appearances and producing the band's next album Love You (1977), a quirky collection of 14 songs mostly written, arranged and produced by Brian. Brian revealed to Peter Ames Carlin that Love You is one of his favorite Beach Boys releases, telling him ""That's when it all happened for me. That's where my heart lies.""Love You peaked at number 28 in the UK and number 53 in the US and developed a cult following; regarded as one of the band's best albums by fans and critics alike, and an early work of synthpop. 

""A diseased bunch of motherfuckers if ever there was one ... But the miracle is that the Beach Boys have made that disease sound like the literal babyflesh pink of health ... Maybe it's just that unprickable and ingenuous wholesomeness that accounts not only for their charm, but for their beauty--a beauty so awesome that listening to them at their best is like being in some vast dream cathedral decorated with a thousand gleaming American pop culture icons."" 

--Lester Bangs in a review of Love You for Circus, June 9, 1977.

Referring to ""naysayers"" of the album, the underground fanzine Scram wrote ""fuck them ... the album showcases a truly original mix of humor and sadness. The original numbers always dance just a step away from the cliché, dealing with simple lyrical themes that make you wonder why they had never been explored before.""The A.V. Club - considering the album to be in ""the same vein"" as Tonight's the Night (1975), Pussy Cats (1974), The Madcap Laughs (1970), and Barrett (1970) - described Love You: ""something almost desperately optimistic ... Wilson sings frayed songs about roller-skating, road-tripping, and Johnny Carson--like a frazzled man sitting in a corner chanting 'calm blue ocean' over and over. It's a beautiful, noisy, funny, heartbreaking work of art--one not for everybody, yet vital for anyone who wants to understand Wilson's overall worldview."" 
After Love You was released, Brian began to record and assemble Adult/Child, an unreleased effort largely consisting of songs written by Wilson from 1976 and 1977 with select big band arrangements by Dick Reynolds. Though publicized as the Beach Boys' next release, Adult/Child caused tension within the group and was ultimately shelved. Following this period, his concert appearances with the band gradually diminished and their performances were occasionally erratic. 
The internal wrangling came to a head after a show at Central Park on September 1, 1977, when the band effectively split into two camps; Dennis and Carl Wilson on one side, Mike Love and Al Jardine on the other with Brian remaining neutral. Following a confrontation on an airport tarmac, Dennis declared to Rolling Stone on September 3 that he had left the band: ""It was Al Jardine who really knifed me in the heart when he said they didn't need me. That was the clincher. And all I told him was that he couldn't play more than four chords. They kept telling me I had my solo album now Pacific Ocean Blue, like I should go off in a corner and leave the Beach Boys to them. The album really bothers them. They don't like to admit it's doing so well; they never even acknowledge it in interviews."" 
The band broke up for two and a half weeks, until a meeting on September 17 at Brian's house. In light of a potential new Caribou Records contract the parties negotiated a settlement resulting in Love gaining control of Brian's vote in the group, allowing Love and Jardine to outvote Carl and Dennis Wilson on any matter. 

1978-present:

Intergroup struggles:
The Beach Boys' last album for Reprise, M.I.U. Album (1978), was recorded at Maharishi International University in Iowa at the suggestion of Love. Dennis and Carl made limited contributions; the album was mostly produced by Jardine and Ron Altbach, with Brian credited as ""executive producer"".M.I.U. was largely a contractual obligation to finish out their association with Reprise, who likewise did not promote the result. The record cemented the divisions in the group. Love and Jardine focused on rock and roll-oriented material while Carl and Dennis chose the progressive focus they had established with the albums Carl and the Passions and Holland. 
Dennis withdrew from the group to focus on his second solo album entitled Bambu. The album was shelved just as alcoholism and marital problems overcame all three Wilson brothers. Carl appeared intoxicated during concerts (especially at appearances for their 1978 Australia tour) and Brian gradually slid back into addiction and an unhealthy lifestyle. 
After departing Reprise, the Beach Boys signed with CBS Records. They received a substantial advance and were paid $1 million per album even as CBS deemed their preliminary review of the band's first product, L.A. (Light Album) as unsatisfactory. Faced with the realization that Brian was unable to contribute, the band recruited Johnston as producer. The result paid off, as ""Good Timin'"" became a top 40 single. The group enjoyed moderate success with a disco reworking of the Wild Honey song ""Here Comes the Night"" which was followed by their highest charting UK single in nine years: Jardine's ""Lady Lynda"" peaked at number 6 in the UK Singles Chart. The album was followed in 1980 by Keepin' the Summer Alive, with Johnston once again producing. Barring an appearance on percussion on the closing track, ""Endless Harmony"", Dennis was absent from this album. 
In 1981, Carl quit the group due to unhappiness with the band's nostalgia format and lackluster live performances, subsequently pursuing a solo career. He returned in May 1982 - after approximately 14 months of being away - on the condition that the group reconsider their rehearsal and touring policies, along with refraining from ""Las Vegas-type engagements"". 

From 1980 through 1982, the Beach Boys and The Grass Roots performed Independence Day concerts at the National Mall in Washington, D.C., attracting large crowds. However, in April 1983, James G. Watt, President Ronald Reagan's Secretary of the Interior, banned Independence Day concerts on the Mall by such groups. Watt said that ""rock bands"" that had performed on the Mall on Independence Day in 1981 and 1982 had encouraged drug use and alcoholism and had attracted ""the wrong element"", who would mug attendees. During the ensuing uproar, which included over 40,000 complaints to the Department of the Interior, the Beach Boys stated that the Soviet Union, which had invited them to perform in Leningrad in 1978, ""obviously ... did not feel that the group attracted the wrong element"". Vice President George H. W. Bush said of the Beach Boys, ""They're my friends and I like their music"". Watt later apologized to the band after learning that President Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan were fans. White House staff presented Watt with a plaster foot with a hole in it, showing that he had ""shot himself in the foot"". The band returned to D.C. for Independence Day in 1984 and performed to a crowd of 750,000 people. 

Deaths of Dennis and Carl:
Dennis' ongoing personal problems kept him out of the group's activities. His alcoholism continued to escalate, and on December 28, 1983, he drowned in Marina del Rey while diving from a friend's boat trying to recover items he had previously thrown overboard in fits of rage. Despite his death, the Beach Boys continued as a successful touring act. 
On July 4, 1985, the Beach Boys played to an afternoon crowd of one million in Philadelphia and the same evening they performed for over 750,000 people on the Mall in Washington (the day's historic achievement was recorded in the Guinness Book of World Records). They also appeared nine days later at the Live Aid concert. That year, they released the eponymous album The Beach Boys and enjoyed a resurgence of interest later in the 1980s, assisted by tributes such as David Lee Roth's hit version of ""California Girls"". ""Getcha Back"", released from the album, gave the group a number 26 single in the US. Following this, the group put out ""Rock 'n' Roll to the Rescue"" (US, number 68) and a cover of the Mamas & the Papas' ""California Dreamin' (US, number 57). In 1987, they played with the rap group The Fat Boys, performing the song ""Wipe Out"" and filming a music video. It was a number 12 single in the US. and a number two rank in the UK. 
By 1988, Brian had drifted from the Beach Boys and released his first solo album, Brian Wilson, which received critical acclaim. During this period the band unexpectedly claimed their first US number one hit single in 22 years with ""Kokomo"", which had appeared in the movie Cocktail, and soon became the band's largest selling single of all time. Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame earlier in the year, the group became the second artist after Aretha Franklin to hit number one in the US after their induction. They released the album Still Cruisin', which went gold in the US and gave them their best chart showing since 1976. In 1990, the band gathered several studio musicians and recorded the Melcher-produced title track of the comedy Problem Child. The album Summer in Paradise, having no new contributions from Brian due to interference from caretaker Eugene Landy, was released two years later to a poor critical reception, and was a commercial disaster. 
A lawsuit was filed by Brian in 1989 to reclaim the rights to his songs and the group's publishing company, Sea of Tunes, which he had supposedly signed away to his father Murry in 1969. He successfully argued that he had not been mentally fit to make an informed decision and that his father had potentially forged his signature. While Wilson failed to regain his copyrights, he was awarded $25 million for unpaid royalties. Soon after Wilson won his case, Love discovered that Murry Wilson had not properly credited him as co-writer on 79 Beach Boys songs. With Love and Brian unable to determine exactly what Love was properly owed, Love sued Brian in 1992, winning $13 million in 1994 for lost royalties. 35 of the group's songs were then amended to credit Love. 
In 1993, the band appeared in Michael Feeney Callan's film The Beach Boys Today, which included in-depth interviews with all members except Brian. Carl confided to Callan that Brian would record again with the band at some point in the near future. A few Beach Boys sessions devoted to new Brian Wilson compositions occurred during the mid-1990s, but they remain largely unreleased, and the album was quickly aborted due to tenuous relations. In February 1996, the Beach Boys guested with Status Quo on a re-recording of ""Fun, Fun, Fun"", which became a British Top-30 hit. In June, the group worked with comedian Jeff Foxworthy on the recording ""Howdy From Maui"", and eventually released Stars and Stripes Vol. 1 in August 1996. The album consisted of country renditions of several Beach Boys hits, performed by popular country artists such as Toby Keith and Willie Nelson. Brian, who was in a better mental state at the time, acted as co-producer. 
In early 1997, Carl was diagnosed with lung cancer and brain cancer after years of heavy smoking. Despite his terminal condition, Carl continued to perform with the band on its 1997 summer tour while undergoing chemotherapy. During performances, he sat on a stool and reportedly needed oxygen after every song. However, Carl was able to stand when he played on ""God Only Knows"". Carl died on February 6, 1998, two months after the death of the Wilsons' mother, Audree. 

Band split and name conflicts:

Following Carl's death, the remaining members splintered. Love, Johnston and former guitarist Marks continued to tour without Jardine, initially as ""America's Band"", but following several cancelled bookings under that name, they sought authorization through Brother Records Inc. (BRI) to tour as ""The Beach Boys"" and secured the necessary license. In turn Jardine began to tour regularly with his band dubbed ""Beach Boys: Family & Friends"" until he ran into legal issues for using the name without license; meanwhile, Jardine sued Love and Brian claiming that he had been excluded from their concerts. BRI, through its longtime attorney, Ed McPherson, sued Jardine in Federal Court. Jardine, in turn, counter-claimed against BRI for wrongful termination. BRI ultimately prevailed after several years. Love was allowed to continue to tour as The Beach Boys, while Jardine was prohibited from touring using any form of the name. 
Released from Landy's control, Brian Wilson sought different treatments for his illnesses that aided him in his solo career. He toured regularly with his backing band consisting of members of Wondermints and other LA/Chicago musicians. Marks also maintained a solo career. Their tours remained reliable draws, with Wilson and Jardine both remaining legal members of the Beach Boys organization and BRI. The surviving group members appeared as themselves for the 1998 documentary film Endless Harmony: The Beach Boys Story, directed by Alan Boyd. Following the success of 1997's The Pet Sounds Sessions, many compilations were then issued by Capitol containing new archival material: Endless Harmony Soundtrack (1998), Ultimate Christmas (1998), and Hawthorne, CA (2001). 
In 2004, Wilson recorded and released his solo album Brian Wilson Presents Smile, a reinterpretation of the Smile project that he initiated with the Beach Boys thirty-six years earlier. That September, Wilson issued a free CD through the Mail On Sunday that included Beach Boys songs he'd recently rerecorded, five of which he'd co-authored with Love. The 10 track compilation had 2.6 million copies distributed and prompted Love to file a lawsuit in November 2005; he claimed the promotion hurt the sales of the original recordings. Love's suit was dismissed in 2007 when a judge determined that there were no triable issues. 
On June 13, 2006, the five surviving Beach Boys (Wilson, Love, Jardine, Johnston, and Marks) appeared together for the celebration of the 40th anniversary of Pet Sounds and the double-platinum certification of their greatest hits compilation, Sounds of Summer: The Very Best of The Beach Boys, in a ceremony atop the Capitol Records building in Hollywood. Plaques were awarded for their efforts, with Wilson accepting on behalf of Dennis and Carl. Throughout the year, it was rumored that the band would reform to perform the Pet Sounds album live in its entirety in November. Ultimately, Wilson began a brief Pet Sounds tour with Jardine and no other group members. 

50th year reunion celebration:

On October 31, 2011, the Beach Boys released surviving 1960s recordings from Smile in the form of The Smile Sessions. The album--even in its incomplete form--garnered universal critical acclaim and experienced popular success, charting in both the Billboard US and UK Top 30. The band was rewarded with glowing reviews, including inclusion in Rolling Stone's Top 500 album list at number 381. The Smile Sessions went on to win Best Historical Album at the 2013 Grammy Awards. Brian Wilson personally accepted the award stating ""I guess Van Dyke and I were on to something after all."" 
In February 2011, the Beach Boys released ""Don't Fight the Sea"", a charity single to aid the victims of the 2011 Japan earthquake. The single, released on Jardine's 2011 album A Postcard From California featured Jardine, Wilson, Love and Johnston, with prerecorded vocals by Carl Wilson. Rumors then circulated regarding a potential 50th anniversary band reunion. 
On December 16, 2011, it was announced that Wilson, Love, Jardine, Johnston and Marks would reunite for a new album and 50th anniversary tour in 2012 to include a performance at the New Orleans Jazz Festival in April 2012. On February 12, 2012, the Beach Boys performed at the 2012 Grammy Awards, in what was billed as a ""special performance"" by organizers. It marked the group's first live performance to include Brian since 1996. The Beach Boys then appeared at the April 10, 2012, season opener for the Los Angeles Dodgers and performed ""Surfer Girl"" along with ""The Star-Spangled Banner"". In April, the new album's title was revealed as That's Why God Made the Radio. The first single from the album, the title track, made its national radio debut April 25, 2012, on ESPN's Mike and Mike in the Morning and was released on iTunes and other digital platforms on April 26.That's Why God Made the Radio debuted at number three on US charts, making US chart history by expanding the group's span of Billboard 200 top ten albums across 49 years and one week, passing the Beatles with 47 years of top ten albums. 
Later in 2012, the group released the Fifty Big Ones and Greatest Hits compilations along with reissues of 12 of their albums. The next year, the group released Live - The 50th Anniversary Tour a 41 song, 2-CD set documenting their 50th Anniversary Tour. While there were no definite plans, Brian stated that he would like to make another Beach Boys album following the world tour. In August 2013, the group released Made in California, a six disc collection featuring more than seven and a half hours of music, including more than 60 previously unreleased tracks, and concluding the Beach Boys' 50th anniversary campaign. That same year, former members of the Beach Boys touring band, Bobby Figueroa, Billy Hinsche, Ed Carter, Matt Jardine (son of Al Jardine), and Philip Bardowell (sometimes with Randell Kirsch and others) united to form California Surf, Incorporated, performing Beach Boy songs. 

Resumed band split:

In June 2012, Love announced additional touring dates which would not feature Wilson. Wilson then denied knowledge of these new dates. On October 5, Love announced in a self-written press release to the LA Times that the band would return to its pre-50th Reunion Tour lineup with him and Johnston touring as the Beach Boys without Wilson, Jardine, and Marks: 

I did not fire Brian Wilson from the Beach Boys. I cannot fire Brian Wilson from the Beach Boys ... I do not have such authority. And even if I did, I would never fire Brian Wilson from the Beach Boys. ... This tour was always envisioned as a limited run ... As the year went on, Brian and Al wanted to keep the 50th anniversary tour going beyond the 75 dates ... However ... we had already set up shows in smaller cities with ... the configuration that had been touring together every year for the last 13 years. Brian and Al would not be joining for these small market dates, as was long agreed upon. 

Four days later, Wilson and Jardine submitted a written response to the rumors stating: ""After Mike booked a couple of shows with Bruce, Al and I were, of course, disappointed. Then there was confusion in some markets when photos of me, Al and David and the 50th reunion band appeared on websites advertising his shows ... I was completely blindsided by his press release ... We hadn't even discussed as a band what we were going to do with all the offers that were coming in for more 50th shows."" Love accused Wilson's statements in this press release to be falsified by his agents, again affirming that the presupposed agreements were ""well-documented"", and that Wilson had halted further touring dates. On December 13, Wilson and Jardine played a Christmas show at which they performed the Beach Boys Christmas songs. Following this appearance, Wilson announced concert dates featuring himself, Jardine and Marks. Love and Johnston continued to perform under the Beach Boys name, while Wilson, Jardine, and Marks continued to tour as a trio, and a subsequent tour with guitarist Jeff Beck also included former Beach Boy Blondie Chaplin at select dates. Reflecting upon the band's reunion in 2013, Love stated: ""I had a wonderful experience being in the studio together. Brian has lost none of his ability to structure those melodies and chord progressions, and when we heard us singing together coming back over the speakers it sounded like 1965 again. Touring was more for the fans. ... It was a great experience, it had a term to it, and now everyone's going on with their ways of doing things."" 
Jardine, Marks, Johnston and Love appeared together at the 2014 Ella Awards Ceremony, where Love was honored for his work as a singer. Marks sang ""409"" in honor of Love while Jardine performed ""Help Me Rhonda"". They closed the show by performing ""Fun, Fun, Fun"". Wilson's long time band associate Jeff Foskett also appeared, but not Wilson. On May 15, 2014 the touring Beach Boys (Love and Johnston) announced a tour celebrating ""50 Years of 'Fun Fun Fun'"", named for their 1964 single. The tour featured the addition of Foskett, who replaced Mike's son Christian. Foskett left Wilson's band due to encumbering responsibilities, and hopes that Wilson and Love's band would someday converge, believing that the two Beach Boys don't ""personally have a problem with each other."" As of September 2014, Jardine has maintained that a continued reunion with the Beach Boys is ""really up to him Love ... He claims he didn't, that he fired us after the reunion ... He's a brilliant songwriter, and unfortunately he has brilliant lawyers. We wish him all the best, but doggonit, you know, we'd like to be Beach Boys, too. There you go."" As Jardine restates ""Love doesn't really want to work with us,"" biographer Jon Stebbins speculated that Love declined to continue working with the group due to the lesser control he had over the touring process, coupled with the lower financial gain, noting: ""Night after night after night after night, Mike is making less money getting reminded that Brian is more popular than him. And he has to answer to people instead of calling all the shots himself."" 
In 2015, Soundstage aired an episode featuring Wilson performing with Jardine and former Beach Boys Blondie Chaplin and Ricky Fataar at The Venetian in Las Vegas. In April 2015, when asked if he was interested in making music with Love again, Wilson replied: ""I don't think so, no."" 

Musical style and development:
See also: The Beach Boys lineups
In Understanding Rock: Essays in Musical Analysis, music theorist Daniel Harrison summarizes: 

Even from their inception, the Beach Boys were an experimental group. They combined, as Jim Miller has put it, ""the instrumental sleekness of the Ventures, the lyric sophistication of Chuck Berry, and the vocal expertise of some weird cross between the Lettermen and Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers"" with lyrics whos images, idioms, and concerns were drawn from the rarefied world of the middle-class white male southern California teenager. ... But it was the profound vocal virtuosity of the group, coupled with the obsessional drive and compositional ambitions of their leader, Brian Wilson, that promised their survival after the eventual breaking of fad fever. ... Comparison to other vocally oriented rock groups, such as the Association, shows the Beach Boys' technique to be far superior, almost embarrassingly so. They were so confident of their ability, and of Brian's skill as a producer to enhance it, that they were unafraid of doing sophisticated, a cappella glee-club arrangements containing multiple suspensions, passing formations, complex chords, and both chromatic and enharmonic modulations. 

Influenced by doo-wop and rhythm and blues, they began as a garage band playing 1950s style rock and roll. During their early years, the Beach Boys released music that displayed an increasing level of sophistication, a period where Brian Wilson consistently acted as the group's primary bandleader, songwriter, producer, and arranger for the group's most commercially and critically successful work. Together, the band reassembled styles of music such as surf to include vocal jazz harmony, creating their unique sound. In addition, they introduced their signature approach to common genres such as the pop ballad by applying harmonic or formal twists not native to rock and roll. Miller observed, ""On straight rockers they sang tight harmonies behind Love's lead ... on ballads, Brian played his falsetto off against lush, jazz-tinged voicings, often using (for rock) unorthodox harmonic structures."" Harrison adds, ""But even the least distinguished of the Beach Boys' early uptempo rock 'n' roll songs show traces of structural complexity at some level; Brian was simply too curious and experimental to leave convention alone."" This new sound was quickly associated with the Modernism movement blooming in the Los Angeles music scene. The band later went on to incorporate many genres, from baroque pop to psychedelia and synthpop. 
In early 1964, Brian began his breakaway from beach-themed music. Later in November of the same year, the group expressed desires to advance from the surf rock style for which they initially became known for. Experimentation with psychotropic substances proved pivotal to the group's development as artists. The following month, Brian was introduced to cannabis before quickly progressing to LSD in early 1965. Of his first acid trip, Brian recalled that the drug had subjected him to ""a very religious experience"" which enlightened him to indescribable philosophies. The music for ""California Girls"", the first Beach Boys song which Bruce Johnston participated in, came from this first LSD experience, as did much of the group's subsequent work where they would often partake in drug use during recording sessions. 
Brian is quoted saying: ""Everyone contributed something. Carl kept us hip to the latest tunes, Al taught us his repertoire of folk songs, and Dennis, though he didn't initially play anything, added a combustible spark just by his presence."" Early on, Love sang lead vocals in the rock-oriented songs, while Carl contributed crisp guitar lines on the group's ballads. In a 1966 article which asks ""Do the Beach Boys rely too much on sound genius Brian?"", Carl responded that every member of the group contributes ideas, but admitted that Brian was majorly responsible for their music. 

Influences:
Further information: List of songs covered by the Beach Boys
The band's earliest influences came primarily from the work of Chuck Berry and the Four Freshmen. Performed by the Four Freshmen, ""Their Hearts Were Full of Spring"" (1961) was a particular favorite of the group. By deconstructing their arrangements of pop standards, Brian educated himself on jazz harmony. Taking this into mind, Philip Lambert noted, ""If Bob Flanigan helped teach Brian how to sing, then Gershwin, Kern, Porter, and the other members of this pantheon helped him learn how to craft a song."" Other general influences on the group included the Hi-Los,the Penguins, the Robins, Bill Haley & His Comets, Otis Williams, the Cadets, the Everly Brothers, the Belmonts, the Shirelles, the Regents, and the Crystals. While the Beach Boys are not often associated with blues, Brian has called this a misapprehension, citing Smokey Robinson and Stevie Wonder as influences. Regarding surf rock pioneer Dick Dale, Brian clarified that his influence on the group was limited to Carl and his style of guitar playing. Carl himself named Berry, the Ventures, and John Walker for shaping his guitar style, and that the Beach Boys had learned to play all of the Ventures' songs by ear early in their career. 
The influence of the Beach Boys' peers combined with Brian's competitive nature drove him to reach higher creative peaks. Sometime around late 1963, he heard the song ""Be My Baby"" (1963) by the Ronettes for the first time, revamping his creative interests and songwriting. ""Be My Baby"" is considered the epitome of Phil Spector's Wall of Sound production technique, a recording method that would fascinate Wilson for the next several decades. Brian later reflected: ""I was unable to really think as a producer up until the time where I really got familiar with Phil Spector's work. That was when I started to design the experience to be a record rather than just a song."" He kept ""Be My Baby"" on his living room jukebox, and would listen to it whenever the mood struck him. According to engineer Larry Levine, ""Brian was one of the few people in the music business Phil respected. There was a mutual respect. Brian might say that he learned how to produce from watching Phil, but the truth is, he was already producing records before he observed Phil. He just wasn't getting credit for it, something that in the early days, I remember really used to make Phil angry. Phil would tell anybody who listened that Brian was one of the great producers."" 
Other prominent inspirations for Brian included Gershwin's ""Rhapsody in Blue"" (1924),the Beatles' Rubber Soul (1965), and composer Burt Bacharach. Author Domenic Priore wrote that, in a subtle way, Brian grew to appreciate the potential of what a pop song could do after being partially spurred on by the dynamics of Bacharach's ""Walk On By"" (1964), a song which would become just as influential to him as ""Be My Baby"", supporting his strive to achieve a sense of dynamics in his recordings while he began pulling away from a purely Spector-inspired approach to production. Brian supported this by saying, ""Burt Bacharach and Hal David are more like me. They're also the best pop team - per se - today. As a producer, Bacharach has a very fresh, new approach."" 

Vocal ability:
Brian identified each member individually for their vocal range, once detailing the ranges for Carl, Dennis, Jardine (""they progress upwards through G, A, and B"") Love (""can go from bass to the E above middle C""), and himself (""I can take the second D in the treble clef""). He declared in 1966 that his greatest interest was to expand modern vocal harmony, owing his fascination with voice to the Four Freshmen which he considered a ""groovy sectional sound"". He added, ""The harmonies that we are able to produce give us a uniqueness which is really the only important thing you can put into records - some quality that no one else has got. I love peaks in a song - and enhancing them on the control panel. Most of all, I love the human voice for its own sake."" Rock critic Erik Davis wrote, ""The 'purity' of tone and genetic proximity that smoothed their voices was almost creepy, pseudo-castrato, and a 'barbershop' sound."" According to Brian: ""Jack Good once told us, 'You sing like eunuchs in a Sistine Chapel,' which was a pretty good quote."" For a period, Brian avoided singing falsetto for the group, saying ""I thought people thought I was a fairy. ... The band told me, 'If that's the way you sing, don't worry about it.'"" 
From lowest intervals to highest, the group's vocal harmony stack usually began with Love or Dennis, followed by Jardine or Carl, and finally Brian on top. Jardine explains, ""We always sang the same vocal intervals. ... As soon as we heard the chords on the piano we'd figure it out pretty easily. If there was a vocal move Brian envisioned, he'd show that particular singer that move. We had somewhat photographic memory as far as the vocal parts were concerned so that never a problem for us."" Striving for absolute perfection, Brian's intricate vocal arrangements exercised the group's calculated blend of intonation, attack, phrasing, and expression. Sometimes, he would sing each vocal harmony part alone through multi-track tape.Jimmy Webb has said, ""They used very little vibrato and sing in very straight tones. The voices all lie down beside each other very easily - there's no bumping between them because the pitch is very precise."" 

As instrumentalists:

The group's instrumental combo initially involved Brian on bass guitar and keyboards, Carl on guitar, and Dennis on drums. From an early age, Brian demonstrated an extraordinary skill for learning music by ear on keyboard. Using major Hollywood recording studios, he arranged many of his compositions for a conglomerate of session musicians informally known as the Wrecking Crew. Their assistance was needed due to the increasingly complicated nature of the material. As a result, a number of songs do not credit the Beach Boys as instrumentalists, but nearly invariably as lead, harmony, or backing vocalists. It's the belief of Richie Unterberger that ""before session musicians took over most of the parts, the Beach Boys could play respectably gutsy surf rock as a self-contained unit."" In spite of this, Carl Wilson continued to play beside these musicians whenever he was available to attend sessions. In archivist Craig Slowinski's view, ""One should not sell short Carl's own contributions; the youngest Wilson had developed as a musician sufficiently to play alongside the horde of high-dollar session pros that big brother was now bringing into the studio. Carl's guitar playing was a key ingredient."" 

Songwriting and production:
See also: Brian Wilson's home studio and Brother Studios
Brian's experiments with his Wollensack tape recorder provide early examples of his flair for exotica and unusual percussive patterns and arranging ideas that he would recycle in later prominent work. Through attending Phil Spector's sessions sporadically, Brian learned how to act as a producer for records while being educated on the Wall of Sound process. From then on, Brian received some production advice from Jan Berry. As they collaborated on several hit singles written and produced for other artists, they recorded what would later be regarded the California Sound. The positive commercial response to Brian's structurally irregular and harmonically varied pop compositions gave him the prestige, resources, and courage to further his creative aspirations. He proceeded to explore many unusual combinations of instruments while emphasizing inventive percussion and progressively ambitious lyricism. 
Although he was often dubbed a perfectionist, Brian was an inexperienced musician, and his understanding was mostly self-taught. He handled most stages of the group's recording process from the beginning, despite Nik Venet being credited for producing their early recordings. With regards to Brian's mid 1960s productions, ethnomusicologist David Toop characterized his style as ""cartoon music and Disney influence mutating into avant-garde pop"". Before 1966, Brian's mastery of songwriting proved that he was capable of applying odd harmonic progressions, unexpected disruptions of hypermeter,jazz theory,tempo changes, metrical ambiguity, and unusual tone colors successfully within a pop context. He made on-the-spot decisions about notes, articulation, and timbre; composing at the mixing board and using the studio as a musical instrument. Sometimes he would write songs which had melodic lines played in different keys at the same time, which confused his session musicians. In most cases, he was forced to rely on outside collaborators when it came to adding lyricism to his compositions. It was at this stage that Brian usually worked with bandmate Mike Love whose assertive persona provided youthful swagger that contrasted Brian's explorations in romanticism and sensitivity. Luis Sanchez noted a pattern where Brian would spare surfing imagery when working with collaborators outside of his band's circle in the examples ""Lonely Sea"" and ""In My Room"". 
He preferred mixing live as performances were recorded, as opposed to mixing after the fact. He was open to changes suggested by others while recording, often taking advice and even incorporating apparent mistakes if they provided a useful or interesting alternative. He experimented with processed effects including varispeed, reverberation, slapback echo, and filtering signals through a Leslie speaker. Lyric collaborator Tony Asher remembers that in the 1960s: ""People would try whatever they could think of that was unexpected, just for its own sake...spend three days and call in a bunch of oboe players. Try an instrument just because nobody had ever used it, and in the end, it wasn't in the final mix. That never happened with Brian. He did the same kind of experimenting, not to see if he could accidentally stumble onto something unique, but he did these unique things because that's what he wanted to hear. And most of the time, it ended up on the record."" Once an instrumental track was completed, vocals would then be overdubbed by the group. On Surfin' U.S.A. (1963), Brian began doubletracking. As was practiced by other record producers from the 1960s, most of his mixes ended up in single-channel monaural, believing that varied stereo speaker placement took his control over the sound image away to the listener. 
Eschewing Capitol Studios which Brian considered inadequate, engineer Chuck Britz often collaborated with him at Western 3 of United Western Recorders, also serving as a buffer between Brian and the oft-berating Murry whenever he was present. Once Britz assembled a preliminary recording setup, Brian would take over the console, directing the instrumentalists from the booth using an intercom or verbal gestures after supplying them with chord charts which were sometimes written incorrectly. It's reported that even though Britz was responsible for setting up recording, Brian would then adjust his configuration to a large extent. Asher adds: ""As unorganized or even unproductive as he Brian could be in other situations, when he got into a recording session, you had the sense he had ideas that were gonna get away from him if he didn't get 'em done right away. He was willing to have people be relaxed and joke a little bit, but he wanted to get work done. And he sometimes lost his temper just a little bit if Chuck couldn't find a take."" At Gold Star Studios, Brian worked mainly with engineers Stan Ross and, with lesser frequency, Larry Levine. Ross said of Brian, ""he liked the sound Gold Star got on the instrumentation, but he did the voices elsewhere because we were limited to two or three tracks and that wasn't enough for voice overdubbing. ... The tracks were really rhythm pads that would be sweetened after the voices were put on."" 

As Brian's productions advanced, he became recognized for his pop artistry, vocal harmonization, incessant studio perfectionism, forward-thinking song structures, engineering and mixing know-how, and creative multitasking abilities. It was unusual among rock groups that Brian wrote his own arrangements. This included his own string orchestrations, which Asher referred to for their odd voicings and classical style. Session bassist Carol Kaye noted, ""We had to create instrumental parts for all the other groups we cut for, but not Brian. We were in awe of Brian."" Friend Danny Hutton expressed similar feelings while highlighting Brian's studio proficiency, citing what he believed to be an extraordinary talent at harnessing several different studio spaces while piecing together discrete instrumental patterns and timbres cohesively. He noted, ""Somebody could go in right after Brian's session and try to record, and they could never get the sound he got. There was a lot of subtle stuff he did. ... People don't talk that much about it. They always talk about his music. He was fabulous in the studio, in terms of getting sounds. You'd sit there, and that was him. He was just hands-on. He would change the reverb and the echo, and all of a sudden, something just - whoa! - got twice as big and fat."" 
Foreshadowed by Beach Boys' Party! (1965), much of the group's recordings from 1967 to 1970 displayed sparse instrumentation, a more relaxed ensemble, and a seeming inattention to production quality. Brian briefly experimented with musique concrete and minimalist rock approaches to music before retreating to his home recording studio to record ""manic"" material in the 1970s, enacting syncopated exercises and counterpoints layered on jittery eighth note tone clusters and loping shuffle grooves. During the infancy of Brian's home studio, the group was forced to improvise many technical aspects of recording. In one instance, they used an empty swimming pool as an echo chamber. 
When Brian abdicated from the group, the other members were forced to take a more active production role. This is believed to have faltered the quality of their music.Richie Unterberger believes that after the December 1967 release of Wild Honey, ""the Beach Boys were revealed as a group that, although capable of producing some fine and interesting music, were no longer innovators on the level of the Beatles and other figureheads."" The album marked the beginning of Carl's increased role as producer, who described it as ""music for Brian to cool out by,"" signaling a mellower approach which would pervade into the 1970s. In 1968, Dennis contributed original songs to Friends, revealing himself as a broodingly soulful songwriter and singer, while Bruce Johnston devised a moody instrumental, ""The Nearest Faraway Place"", for 20/20 the following year.Sunflower (1970) marked an end to the experimental songwriting and production phase initiated by Smiley Smile (1967). Of the albums between Surf's Up (1971) and Holland (1973), Daniel Harrison wrote that they ""contain a mixture of middle-of-the-road music entirely consonant with pop style during the early 1970s with a few oddities that proved that the desire to push beyond conventional boundaries was not dead."" While Harrison adamantly states ""1974 is the year in which the Beach Boys ceased to be a rock 'n' roll act and became an oldies act,""Love You (1977) is perceived by some as an oddity that sounds like no other record in their catalog with synthesizer-laden arrangements played almost entirely by Brian.

Cultural impact and influence:
See also: List of cover versions of Beach Boys songs

Regarded by some critics as one of the greatest American rock groups and an important catalyst in the evolution of popular music, the Beach Boys are one of the most critically acclaimed, commercially successful, and widely influential bands of all time. The Beach Boys' sales estimates range from 100 to 350 million records worldwide, and have influenced artists spanning many genres and decades. The group's early songs made them major pop stars in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and other countries, having sixteen hit singles between 1962 and 1965. They were one of the few American bands formed prior to the 1964 British Invasion to continue their success. Among artists of the 1960s, they are one of few central figures in the histories of rock. 
Their early hits helped raise the profile of the state of California, creating its first major regional style with national significance, and establishing a musical identity for Southern California, as opposed to Hollywood. This also associated the band with surfing, hot-rod racing, and a contemporaneous teenage lifestyle and fantasy. There had been surf bands formed prior to the Beach Boys, but none which projected a world view as the Beach Boys did. The resultant ""California Sound"" later morphed itself to reflect a more musically ambitious and mature world view, becoming less to do with surfing and cars and more about social consciousness and political awareness. Between 1964 and 1969, it fueled innovation and transition, inspiring artists to tackle largely unmentioned themes such as sexual freedom, black pride, drugs, oppositional politics, and war. 
Brian's work is credited as a major innovation in the field of music production. According to Erik Davis, ""Not only did the Beach Boys write a soundtrack to the early '60s, but Brian let loose a delicate and joyful art pop unique in music history and presaged the mellowness so fundamental to '70s California pop.""The A.V. Club wrote that Brian was among ""studio rats ... that set the pace for how pop music could and should sound in the Flower Power era: at once starry-eyed and wistful."" Only 21-years-old when he received the freedom to produce his own records with total creative autonomy, he ignited an explosion of like-minded California producers, supplanting New York as the center of popular records, and becoming the first rock producer to use the studio as a discrete instrument. The Beach Boys were thus one of the first rock groups to exert studio control. 
The group was among early (or earliest) instigators of psychedelic rock,acid rock,art rock,art pop,progressive rock, and sunshine pop. They attracted a following from a great number of their pop or rock contemporaries during the 1960s, including the Beatles,the Rolling Stones,Harry Nilsson,Cream,George Martin,the Who,Pink Floyd,Lou Reed of The Velvet Underground, and Frank Zappa. Additionally, they influenced pioneering musicians for glam rock: David Bowie and Marc Bolan;krautrock: Faust,Kraftwerk;power pop: Big Star; and new wave: Talking Heads. 
The Beach Boys helped create power pop, and in the 1970s, they were paid homage by punk rockers such as Ramones,Patti Smith, and Lester Bangs. Partly in due to the Ramones, many acts which Stereogum called ""punk or punk-adjacent"" showcased influence from the Beach Boys: Slickee Boys, Agent Orange, Bad Religion, Shonen Knife, the Queers, Hi-Standard, the Donnas, M.O.D.. and the Vandals. The group eventually bore a strong influence on indie rock. Over the years, the group's songs have been the subject of many tribute albums, several of which are compiled from cover versions contributed by various artists from a wide range of backgrounds including Japanese noise, pop punk, rockabilly, and trip hop. 
In the 1990s, the Beach Boys received a resurgence of popularity with alternative rock groups and young record-buyers of independent music. According to Sean O'Hagan of the High Llamas, ""they stopped listening to indie records"" in favor of the Beach Boys. Bands who advocated for the band included founding members of the Elephant 6 Collective: Neutral Milk Hotel, the Olivia Tremor Control, the Apples in Stereo, and of Montreal. United by a shared love of the Beach Boys' music, they named Pet Sounds Studio in honor of the group. Other influenced artists who gained prominence in underground circles during the 1980s and 1990s include shoegaze band My Bloody Valentine,electronica outfits Daft Punk,Saint Etienne,The High Llamas,the Avalanches,Stereolab, and alternative rock musicians Radiohead,Sonic Youth,Frank Black of Pixies,Jim Reid of the Jesus and Mary Chain, and Paddy McAloon of Prefab Sprout. In Japan, their music affected the work of noise rock bands Seagull Screaming Kiss Her Kiss Her and Melt-Banana. 
Other 20th century artists influenced by the Beach Boys include ABBA,Rivers Cuomo of Weezer,Fleetwood Mac,Cheap Trick,Chicago,Elton John,Flipper's Guitar,Todd Rundgren,Keiichi Suzuki,Yo La Tengo,Tatsuro Yamashita,Yellow Magic Orchestra, and XTC. The Beach Boys' influence has continued to pervade in such millennial artists as Air,Animal Collective,Fleet Foxes,MGMT,Super Furry Animals, and Frank Ocean. 

Reappraisal:
Professor of cultural studies James M. Curtis wrote in 1987, 

... we can say that the Beach Boys represent the outlook and values of white Protestant Anglo-Saxon teenagers in the early sixties. Having said that, we immediately realize that they must mean much more than this. Their stability, their staying power, and their ability to attract new fans prove as much. 

Historian Darren R. Reid added in 2013, ""Imagine, if you will, a world in which the Beatles were known only for their early hits whilst The White Album or Abbey Road were of interest, or even known, only to the group's biggest fans, and you will have some grasp of how the Beach Boys' distorted public image has helped to bury their most important artistic works."" 

Throughout their career, the Beach Boys struggled with their public image and audiences. Musicologist Charlie Gillett explains, ""By 1965, the Beach Boys had become an American pop institution, but although they continued to cultivate a visual image in line with their name and early repertoire, there was a limit to how many different ways Wilson could celebrate the wonders of living in Southern California ... Originally, many serious pop fans dismissed the group as trashy pop for kids."" Their growing complexity caused their live performances to suffer in the mid 1960s, when the group began to be derided by audiences for their uniformed striped shirts compounded by low key reproductions of songs which demanded complicated orchestrations. Because of their early hits, which celebrated a politically unconscious youth culture, the group's legitimacy in rock music became an oft-repeated criticism toward the band. In 1970, the group ceased wearing matching uniforms on stage and began emphasizing political and social awareness. Drawing from their associations with Charles Manson and Ronald Reagan, Erik Davis observed, ""the Beach Boys may be the only bridge between those deranged poles. There is a wider range of political and aesthetic sentiments in their records than in any other band in those heady times--like the state of California, they expand and bloat and contradict themselves."" 
Despite the group's immense popularity and success, some consider that the extent of their contribution to Western music canon is undervalued. In 1967, Lou Reed famously wrote, ""Will none of the powers that be realize what Brian Wilson did with the chords?""Pitchfork Media posited, ""At some point, you learn that the Beach Boys weren't just a fun 1960s surf band with a run of singles that later came to be used in commercials; at their best, they were making capital-A Art. ... Once you've absorbed Pet Sounds, you find yourself going back through songs like ""Don't Worry Baby"", ""The Warmth of the Sun"", and ""I Get Around"", finding a deeper brilliance where you once heard only pop craftsmanship."" Discussing the 2011 release of The Smile Sessions, The Los Angeles Times wrote, ""...certainly every library of American recording history needs this; university composition departments, music professors, budding recording engineers and composers should study it."" 

I think a lot of critics punish the band for not going beyond ""Good Vibrations"" ... I think they love the band so much that they get crazy because we don't top ourselves. ... every time there's a new Beach Boy record it competes with so many old Beach Boy records on the radio. ... the audience is so young and they're reacting more to the Beach Boys sound-alike commercials on TV and the three or four really big, quadruple platinum repackage albums. I'm not down on any of that stuff, but ... growth in this business is tough 

--Bruce Johnston speaking to the Houston Chronicle, August 1982

Online publication NewMusicBox - which normally devotes itself to new American music that is outside the commercial mainstream - argued that the Beach Boys could never earn themselves ""the same pride of place in American music history held by other great innovators"" because of their mistaken reputation as a ""light-hearted party band that drooled over 'California Girls' while on a 'Surfing Safari'"" hampered not only by the over-saturation of their early songs being used in film, commercials, and other media, but also ""their latter-day cover-band-version-of-their-former-selves concert appearances"". Referring to the groups' reaction to the commercial success of their 1974 greatest hits compilation Endless Summer, Daniel Harrison writes, ""they returned to the beach, knowing they would never leave it again."" Erik Davis wrote that by 1990, ""the Beach Boys are either dead, deranged, or dinosaurs; their records are Eurocentric, square, unsampled; they've made too much money to merit hip revisionism."" From the same period, Jim Miller wrote, ""They have become a figment of their own past, prisoners of their unflagging popularity--incongruous emblems of a sunny myth of eternal youth belied by much of their own best music. ... The group is still largely identified with its hits from the early Sixties."" 
Harrison, however, contests that the group once produced work which could ""almost"" be considered art music in the Western classical tradition, and that group's innovations in the musical language of rock can be compared to those that introduced atonal and other nontraditional techniques into that classical tradition. He explains, ""The spirit of experimentation is just as palpable in Smiley Smile as it is in, say, Schoenberg's op. 11 piano pieces."" While the group ""went into the great void beyond,"" such notions were not widely acknowledged by rock audiences nor by the classically minded at the time. Harrison concludes: ""What influences could these innovations then have? The short answer is, not much. Smiley Smile, Wild Honey, Friends, and 20/20 sound like few other rock albums; they are sui generis. ... It must be remembered that the commercial failure of the Beach Boys' experiments was hardly motivation for imitation. In the end, we must conclude that the Beach Boys' late-1960s experiments were not reproducible."" 

Awards and honors:

The group routinely appears in the upper reaches of ranked lists such as ""The Top 1000 Albums of All Time"". Many of the group's songs and albums including The Beach Boys Today! (1965), Smiley Smile (1967), Sunflower (1970), and Surf's Up (1971) are featured in several lists devoted to the greatest of all time. The 1966 releases Pet Sounds and ""Good Vibrations"" frequently rank among the top of critics' lists of the greatest albums and singles of all time. In 2004, Pet Sounds was preserved in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress for being ""culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant."" On Acclaimed Music, ""Good Vibrations"" is ranked the third best song of all time, while ""God Only Knows"" is ranked twenty-first; the group itself is ranked eleven in its 1000 most recommended artists of all time. 
In 1966 and 1967, reader polls conducted by the UK magazine NME crowned the Beach Boys as the world's number one vocal group, ahead of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. In 1974, the Beach Boys were awarded ""Band of the Year"" by Rolling Stone. On December 30, 1980, the Beach Boys were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, located at 1500 Vine Street. The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988. Ten years later they were selected for the Vocal Group Hall of Fame. In 2001, the group received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked the Beach Boys number 12 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. Brian Wilson was inducted into the UK Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in November 2006. 
The Wilsons' California house, where the Wilson brothers grew up and the group began, was demolished in 1986 to make way for Interstate 105, the Century Freeway.

Biography:
The three members of Nickel Creek met in 1989 at Carlsbad, California's That Pizza Place, listening to weekly bluegrass shows with their parents. Soon they were taking lessons and then playing festivals and recording albums. Their first, Little Cowpoke, was released in 1994. Later albums included Nickel Creek and This Side, which went platinum and won a Grammy for Best Contemporary Folk Album. In 2005, Nickel Creek released Why Should the Fire Die?, which received massive critical acclaim and sold 250,000 units. 
In 2003, Thile married fashion designer Jesse Meighan. The couple divorced in 2004, after 18 months of marriage. 
Thile has also released solo albums, including Not All Who Wander Are Lost (2001) and 2004's Deceiver, on which he wrote, composed, sang, and played every part. In 2008, Thile released a collaboration album with bassist Edgar Meyer, and he also plans to release a collaborative album with Hilary Hahn. 
Thile married actress Claire Coffee on December 23, 2013. Coffee and Thile are expecting their first child, a boy, in May. Their son Calvin Eugene Thile was born on 15 May 2015. 
Thile's great-great-great-great-uncle is Baseball Hall of Fame member Sam Thompson. 

History:

1981-1999: Early life and career:
Thile was born in Oceanside, California in 1981. His earliest memories of music are listening to Stan Getz's recording of ""The Girl from Ipanema"" before he even turned one year old. When he was two, his family started going to That Pizza Place, where he listened to John Moore's band Bluegrass Etc. When Thile was four, his family moved to Idyllwild, California. 
Thile began playing the mandolin at the age of five, taking occasional lessons from John Moore. At age eight, Thile's family and the Watkins family formed Nickel Creek. The band performed at many California bluegrass festivals, and as a result Chris had to be home-schooled. At age twelve, he won the national mandolin championship at the Walnut Valley Festival in Winfield, Kansas. 
That same year, 1993, Thile made a demo tape and sent it to the Sugar Hill and Rounder record labels. Both labels showed interest, but the Thiles went with Sugar Hill. The next year Chris Thile released his first solo album, Leading Off, featuring mostly original compositions. 
In 1995, the Thile family moved to Murray, Kentucky where Chris' father Scott Thile accepted a position at Murray State University as a musical instrument technician. In 1997, Chris released Stealing Second and Nickel Creek released Here to There. Chris went on to attend Murray State University for a few semesters, where he was a music major. 

2000-2005: Wander and Deceiver:
Following the major success and platinum accreditation of the album Nickel Creek, Thile released Not All Who Wander Are Lost in 2001. The album featured guest appearances from several well-known instrumentalists such as Stuart Duncan, Béla Fleck, Edgar Meyer, Jerry Douglas, and Bryan Sutton. 
In 2003, Thile teamed up with mandolinist Mike Marshall for the duet album Into the Cauldron, which included original pieces as well as pieces by Charlie Parker and J. S. Bach. Also in 2003, Thile joined Mark O'Connor for his double CD set ""Thirty-Year Retrospective"" which was nominated for a Grammy. In 2004, Thile released Deceiver, an experimental album on which he recorded every track himself. This included electric guitar, piano, drums, violin, viola, cello, and bass. Deceiver demonstrated some pop/rock songwriting in addition to ""newgrass."" 

2006-present: Punch Brothers and Edgar Meyer project:

In August 2006, Nickel Creek announced that at the end of the year they would no longer be recording together as a group, and their tour scheduled through 2007 would be their last for an indefinite period of time. In February 2014, the group announced that it would be releasing another album. 
Thile was a judge for the fifth annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists' careers. 
In 2006, Thile formed How to Grow a Band, with whom he recorded How to Grow a Woman from the Ground, Thile's fifth album. In an interview with the Nashville City Paper, Thile described the band's formation: 

We got together one night just to drop a ton of money, drink too much wine, eat steaks, and commiserate about our failed relationships. We had gotten to play together a few days before and we had said that we needed to do something musical together. With our hearts smashed to pieces, it became more urgent -- our lives had gone the same way for so long. I knew I wanted to have a band with Gabe Witcher, but I didn't know if it would be a rock ensemble, an ambitious acoustic classical thing or a bluegrass group. We played, and there was a serious, instantaneous connection. Then I knew I wanted to put together a bluegrass band -- one with a lot of range, but aesthetically a bluegrass band. 

The band consisted of Chris Thile (mandolin), Gabe Witcher (fiddle/violin), Chris Eldridge (guitar), Greg Garrison (bass), and Noam Pikelny (banjo). Bryan Sutton has also filled in on guitar when necessary while Eldridge played out commitments to The Infamous Stringdusters. In 2007, the band officially changed its name first to ""The Tensions Mountain Boys"" and then ""Punch Brothers."" 
On March 17, 2007, at Carnegie Hall, this group debuted Thile's ambitious ""The Blind Leaving the Blind"", a 40-minute suite in four movements that Thile told NPR was written in part to deal with his 2004 divorce. 

Punch Brothers released its first album, Punch, February 26, 2008, on Nonesuch Records. The album featured Thile's suite ""The Blind Leaving the Blind"", as well as other original songs. 
To promote Punch, Thile and Punch Brothers planned a year-long tour in 2008, as well as a February 29 appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. In late 2008, Paul Kowert replaced Garrison on bass. Punch Brothers released Antifogmatic on February 15, 2010, and continued to tour. On November 5, 2010, the band performed ""Rye Whiskey"" on the Late Show with David Letterman with Steve Martin guesting on banjo. 
The Punch Brothers released their third album, Who's Feeling Young Now?, in early 2012. 
In November 2014, Punch Brothers released a single entitled ""I Blew It Off,"" from their then-untitled fourth album. In December 2014, the band announced the scheduled release of an upcoming album and simultaneous release of another new single, ""Julep."". 
Punch Brothers latest album The Phosphorescent Blues, was released on January 27, 2015. 
In August 2008, Thile and bassist Edgar Meyer announced the release date of the duo's planned debut album. The album was released on Thile's label Nonesuch Records on September 23, 2008. Commenting on the collaboration, Thile said ""Edgar is one of the biggest influences on my musical life, and now I'm in a duo with him and writing songs with him. This was my dream. I always wondered what it would be like to be playing music this hard."" The duo toured in September and October 2008 to promote the album. 
In 2012, Thile won a MacArthur Fellowship. 
In 2014, Thile recorded a new collaborative album with Edgar Meyer entitled Bass & Mandolin and embarked on a tour with Meyer to support the album. 

Side projects:
Thile is featured in the documentary Bluegrass Journey, along with the rest of Nickel Creek. He has also appeared on a number of other artists' recordings, including Béla Fleck's Perpetual Motion, playing arrangements of Baroque, Impressionist, Classical and other styles of music with Fleck and Edgar Meyer; Jam Session, with Mark O'Connor, Frank Vignola, Bryan Sutton, and Jon Burr; the Dixie Chicks' Home, Kate Rusby's Awkward Annie, Julie Fowlis's Cuilidh, Dolly Parton's Little Sparrow, Dierks Bentley's Up on the Ridge, and Sarah Jarosz's Song Up in Her Head and Follow Me Down. 
Thile has performed as a duo with guitarist and vocalist Michael Daves since 2005. They released their debut album, Sleep With One Eye Open, on May 10, 2011. Recorded at Jack White's studio, the album consists of 16 classic bluegrass duets. Jack White also produced and played on the duo's 7"" vinyl record Man in the Middle on Third Man Records. Thile and Daves met in 2005 at a bluegrass jam at NYC's Baggot Inn. 
In 2009 Thile completed a mandolin concerto entitled Ad astra per alas porci. The work was commissioned by a consortium of orchestras including the Colorado Symphony Orchestra, Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, Oregon Symphony, Alabama Symphony Orchestra, Winston-Salem Symphony, Delaware Symphony Orchestra, Portland Symphony Orchestra, and Interlochen Center for the Arts. Thile performed the world premiere of the first movement with the Interlochen Arts Camp World Youth Symphony Orchestra under director Jung-Ho Pak, and premiered his entire concerto with the Colorado Symphony Orchestra on Sept. 17, 2009. 
In 2011, he recorded The Goat Rodeo Sessions with cellist Yo-Yo Ma, bassist Edgar Meyer and fiddle player Stuart Duncan. On October 25, 2011 he appeared on the Tonight Show as a member of the Yo-Yo Ma and Friends musical act.

Life and career:

1996-2008: Early life:
Ella Yelich-O'Connor was born in Takapuna to civil engineer Vic O'Connor and poet Sonja Yelich on 7 November 1996. She was raised in the nearby suburb of Devonport with two sisters (Jerry and India Yelich-O'Connor) and a brother (Angelo Yelich-O'Connor). She has Croatian and Irish ancestry. At age five, she joined a drama group and developed public speaking skills. In her primary years, Lorde attended Vauxhall School and later Belmont Intermediate School. Her mother encouraged her to read a range of books, which Lorde cited as a lyrical influence, ""I guess my mum influenced my lyrical style by always buying me books. She'd give me a mixture of kid and adult books too, there weren't really any books I wasn't allowed to read. I remember reading Feed by M.T. Anderson when I was six, and her giving me Salinger and Carver at a young age, and Janet Frame really young too."" 

2009-11: Career beginnings:

In May 2009, Lorde and musician friend Louis McDonald won the Belmont Intermediate School annual talent show as a duo. On 13 August 2009, Lorde and McDonald were invited in for a chat on Jim Mora's Afternoons show on Radio New Zealand. There, they performed covers of Pixie Lott's ""Mama Do (Uh Oh, Uh Oh)"" and Kings of Leon's ""Use Somebody"". McDonald's father Ian sent out his home audio recording of her and Louis McDonald covering Duffy's song ""Warwick Avenue"", and his home video recording of Lorde and Louis McDonald singing Pixie Lott's ""Mama Do"", to Universal Music Group (UMG)'s A&R Scott Maclachlan. In 2009 Maclachlan signed her to UMG for development. Lorde was also part of the Belmont Intermediate School band Extreme; the band placed third in the North Shore Battle of the Bands finals at the Bruce Mason Centre, Takapuna, Auckland on 18 November 2009. 
In 2010 Lorde and McDonald performed covers live on a regular basis as a duet called ""Ella & Louis"", playing at The Leigh Sawmill Cafe on 15 August, at Roasted Addiqtion Cafe in Kingsland on 20 August, at The Vic Unplugged at Victoria Theatre, Devonport on 27 October, and at Devonstock in Devonport on 12 December. While working on her music career, she attended Takapuna Grammar School from 2010 to 2013, completing Year Twelve. She later chose not to return in 2014 to finish Year Thirteen. 
In 2011, UMG hired vocal coach Frances Dickinson to give Lorde singing lessons twice a week for a year. During this time, she began writing songs and was set up with a succession of songwriters, but without success. At the age of fourteen, Lorde started reading short fiction and learned how to ""put words together."" She performed her own original songs publicly for the first time at The Vic Unplugged II on the Devonport Victoria Theatre main stage on 16 November 2011. In December 2011, MacLachlan paired Lorde with Joel Little, a songwriter, record producer, and former Goodnight Nurse lead singer. The pair recorded five songs for an EP at Little's Golden Age Studios in Morningside, Auckland, and finished within three weeks. 

2012-13: The Love Club EP and Pure Heroine:

In November 2012, Lorde self-released the record, entitled The Love Club EP, through her SoundCloud account for free download. After being freely downloaded 60,000 times, UMG decided to commercially release the EP for sales in March 2013. The EP peaked at number two on the record charts of New Zealand and Australia. In June of that year, ""Royals"" was released as a single from the EP. The single became a crossover hit, peaking atop the US Billboard Hot 100 for nine consecutive weeks. Consequently, Lorde became the youngest solo artist to achieve a number-one single in the US with ""Royals"", since Tiffany's ""I Think We're Alone Now"" (1987). The track eventually won the 2013 APRA Silver Scroll Award, and two Grammy Awards for Best Pop Solo Performance and Song of the Year at the 2014 Grammy Awards. 
In September 2013, Lorde released her debut studio album, Pure Heroine. The album topped the charts of New Zealand and Australia and reached the top five of several national charts, including Canada, Ireland, Norway and the United Kingdom. In the U.S., Pure Heroine peaked at number three on the Billboard 200, and had sold 1.33 million copies by 2014. Worldwide, Pure Heroine had sold 1.5 million copies by the end of 2013. The album was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album. 
The release of Pure Heroine was preceded by four singles: ""Tennis Court"" was released in June 2013, topping the New Zealand Singles Chart; the third single, ""Team"", became a top-ten hit worldwide; and ""No Better"", a song only included on the extended version of Pure Heroine, and ""Glory and Gore"" were released as the two final singles from the record, respectively. In September 2013, Lorde's cover version of the Tears for Fears' single, ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"", produced by Michael A. Levine and Lucas Cantor, was included on The Hunger Games: Catching Fire film soundtrack. 
In November 2013, Lorde signed a publishing deal with Songs Music Publishing, worth a reported US$2.5 million, after a bidding war between various companies, including Sony Music Entertainment and her label UMG. The agreement gives the publisher the right to license Lorde's music for films and advertising. Late that year, she also started a relationship with photographer James Lowe. 

2014-present: Second album and Mockingjay, Pt. 1 soundtrack:

In December 2013, Lorde announced that she had begun writing material for her second studio album. In June 2014, Lorde said that her second studio album was in its early stages and that, so far, it was ""totally different"" from her debut album. In the first half of 2014, Lorde headlined various festivals, including the Laneway Festival in Sydney, Australia, the three South American editions of Lollapalooza--Chile, Santiago;Buenos Aires, Argentina; and São Paulo, Brazil-- and the Coachella Festival in California. 
To promote The Love Club EP and Pure Heroine, Lorde embarked on an international tour, the first leg of which was held in North America in early 2014. She later announced the Australian leg, held in July, and the second North American leg, held in August. In April of that year, Lorde performed ""All Apologies"" with the surviving members of Nirvana during the band's induction ceremony at the Rock N' Roll Hall of Fame. 
On 1 August 2014, Lorde performed at Lollapalooza again in Grant Park, Chicago. Lorde's set was critically well received, with Billboard selecting it as the fifth-best performance of the festival, while Rolling Stone deemed it the best segment of the Chicago event. 
On 29 September 2014, Lorde released ""Yellow Flicker Beat"" as the first single from the soundtrack album for the film The Hunger Games: Mockingjay -- Part 1; Lorde oversaw the collation of the album's content, in addition to contributing vocals to several songs. By her 18th birthday in November 2014, it was estimated that Lorde was worth NZ$11 million. 

Artistry:

Influences:

Lorde cites Grimes (left) and Fleetwood Mac (right) as two of her prominent musical influences

Lorde grew up listening to American jazz musician Billie Holiday, and soul musicians Sam Cooke, Etta James and Otis Redding, whose music Lorde admires for ""harvesting their suffering."" Additionally, she listened to her parents' favourite records by the likes of Cat Stevens, Neil Young and Fleetwood Mac in her early years. Among those records, Lorde deemed Rumours by Fleetwood Mac as ""a perfect record."" She cites the unusual vocals of Grimes, band Sleigh Bells and producer SBTRKT as her prominent influences. Furthermore, Lorde names Thom Yorke as an influence for his ""smart"" way of using his voice, as well as Nicki Minaj and Kendrick Lamar for their ""sassy"" tone. Other inspirations for Lorde include Lana Del Rey,James Blake, Yeasayer, Animal Collective,Bon Iver, Radiohead, Jamie Woon, Arcade Fire,Kurt Vonnegut, Laurie Anderson,Kanye West and Prince. 
She cites rapper J. Cole and electronic producers as influences, saying that she was impressed by ""their vocals in a really interesting way, whether it might be chopping up a vocal part or really lash or layering a vocal."" Lorde also states that she was inspired by the initially hidden identities of Burial and The Weeknd, explaining, ""I feel like mystery is more interesting"". She names her mother, a poet, as the main influence for her songwriting skill. In addition, Lorde names several authors including Raymond Carver, Wells Tower, Tobias Wolff, Claire Vaye Watkins, Sylvia Plath, Walt Whitman and T. S. Eliot as lyrical inspirations - particularly noting their sentence structures. 

Musical style:
Music critics opine that Lorde's music is drawn from subgenres of electronica, pop, rock: specifically art pop,indie pop,dream pop,electropop,electrorock and indie-electro. Multiple reviewers also note the influences of hip hop and R&B on Lorde's releases. In a review for Consequence of Sound, Jon Hadusek details the minimal production on Lorde's music ""allows her to sing any melody she wants, layering them over one another to create a choral effect."" Jason Lipshutz of Billboard shares that her works features deep bass rumbles, lilting loops and programmed beats.Paul Lester from The Guardian compares Lorde's music to that of Sky Ferreira, Lana Del Rey, Grimes and Eliza Doolittle. 
Lorde is an alto; however, on ""Royals"", she performs with a mezzo-soprano vocal range. Lorde writes her music vocally and does not play musical instruments on her records or onstage. She states that her main focus is her voice, elaborating, ""I don't play any instruments, so my voice needs to have the focus. My vocal-scape is really important.""PopMatters's Evan Sawdey describes Lorde's vocals as being ""unique and powerfully intriguing."" Jason Lipshutz of Billboard praises her vocals for being ""dynamic, smoky and restrained."" Lester characterises Lorde's vocals as ""sweet, sultry and sour"", while James Lachno from The Daily Telegraph details the singer's voice as ""twitchy electro."" In an article for The AV Club, Kevin McFarland writes that ""Lorde's voice is the alpha and omega of her talent. She has the presence and vocal development of singers more than twice her age. Her voice isn't booming or overpowering, but rather mystifying and alluring, both floating on its own in a sea of reverb and digital blips and awash in an army of chorused overdubs."" 

Songwriting and lyrics:
Talking about her collaboration with Joel Little, Lorde shares that Little's refining her ""raw potential to end up with the music"" was one of the best aspects of him. She also views Little as ""the only one who was working with electronic music in the way she was interested in at the time."" Lorde details that her songs are shaped by her lyrics, which she felt as a ""more cohesive way of working."" She said, ""I tend to start with lyrics - sometimes the seed of a song will just be a word that I thought was rad, one that summed up a particular idea I'd been trying to pin down."" Nonetheless, she points out that the songwriting process of ""Tennis Court"" was different to how she normally writes a song: the lyrics are built on the instant music and beat. 
The lyrical content of her two first major releases, The Love Club EP and Pure Heroine, criticises mainstream popular culture. Lindsay Zoladz from Pitchfork Media noted that Lorde expressed her indifference towards modern-day's culture, further explaining that ""Lorde has introduced herself to the world as someone who gives very few fucks."" On behalf of Rolling Stone, critic Jonah Weiner also noted the typical themes of teen pop music, including ""social anxiety, romantic yearning, debilitating ennui and booze-soaked ragers."" Jim Pickney from the New Zealand Listener writes that Lorde's lyrics are structured in a short story manner and praised that her songwriting ability ""combines unmistakably teenage confusion, curiosity and confidence with word skills beyond her years."" 

Public image:

Lorde chose her stage name because she was fascinated with ""royals and aristocracy"". However, she felt the name Lord was too masculine, thus she added an ""e"" to make it more feminine. She described her public image as coming ""naturally"" to her. Her music is noted for the manner in which its view of pop culture is contrasted with that of her contemporaries, such as Miley Cyrus and Rihanna. Lorde is a self-identified feminist. 
In a November 2013 interview with Q, Lorde expressed frustration about ""certain things about music"": ""There are a lot of shock tactics these days. People trying to outdo each other, which will probably culminate in two people fucking on stage at the Grammys."" Following the release of Pure Heroine, she also described herself as a ""sex-positive"" person, elaborating: 

People like to paint me in a certain way, but I'm a hugely sex-positive person and I have nothing against anyone getting naked. For me personally I just don't think it really would complement my music in any way or help me tell a story any better. It's not like I have a problem with dancing around in undies--I think you can use that stuff in a hugely powerful way. It just hasn't felt necessary for me. 

In November 2013, Lorde was included in Time‍ '​s list of the most influential teenagers in the world, with Mark Metcalfe from the publication commenting that she was ""forging her own path."" In January 2014, Forbes placed Lorde on their ""30 Under 30"" list of young people ""who are changing our world."" Additionally, she was the youngest individual to be featured on the list. In October of that year, Lorde was included in the list ""The 25 Most Influential Teens of 2014"" by Time.Billboard named Lorde ""The New Queen of Alternative"".Britney Spears named Lorde as an influence, commenting that her music ""is really different and cool."" 
In June 2014, Lorde released a two-piece make-up limited edition collection in collaboration with MAC Cosmetics, consisting of a lipstick titled after her debut album, Pure Heroine, and an eyeliner. She filmed a video for the Electoral Commission to encourage voter turnout of young people at the 2014 New Zealand general election, despite being too young to vote at the time. On 13 May 2015, a wax figure of Lorde was introduced to the Madame Tussauds Hollywood. 

Awards and nominations:
Following her breakthrough, Lorde won four New Zealand Music Awards at the 2013 ceremony. ""Royals"" additionally earned the New Zealand APRA Scroll Silver Awards in that year. At the 2014 Grammy Awards, Lorde received two Grammy Awards for her single ""Royals"" in the categories Best Pop Solo Performance and Song of the Year.

The bandmates eventually moved to Harlem and became a part of the burgeoning New York City rock scene.  The band was formed in 2000 following the breakup of two separate bands: Jonathan Fire*Eater, whose members included Martin, Maroon and Barrick, and The Recoys, whose members included Leithauser and Bauer. The three members from Jonathan Fire*Eater, which had recorded for Dreamworks Records, had money left over from that past recording contract and used the remaining funds to construct a rehearsal space in uptown New York. The rehearsal space featured a 24-track recording studio and was dubbed Marcata Studios.

History:

Early years:
Each of the members of The Walkmen grew up in and around the Washington, DC area, played in many of the same bands from early in their careers, and even attended the same Washington-area high school, St. Albans School (Washington, D.C.). The bandmates eventually moved to Harlem. 
The band was formed in 2000 following the breakup of two separate bands: Jonathan Fire*Eater, whose members included Martin, Maroon and Barrick, and The Recoys, whose members included Leithauser and Bauer. The three members from Jonathan Fire*Eater, which had recorded for Dreamworks Records, had money left over from that past recording contract and used the remaining funds to construct a rehearsal space in uptown New York. The rehearsal space featured a 24-track recording studio and was dubbed Marcata Studios. 
The newly formed band, who wished to distance themselves from the garage rock sounds of previous bands, released a self-titled EP of songs in 2001 on Startime International, a small Brooklyn-based record label. Shortly after the release of the EP, which featured a blend of upright pianos and other vintage instruments, The Walkmen made their official live debut with a performance at Joe's Pub in the East Village. 

Everyone Who Pretended to Like Me Is Gone:
The 2002 debut album Everyone Who Pretended to Like Me Is Gone, released by Startime, was well received by critics. The album was noted for its innovative approach to atmosphere and instrumentation, with sparse bass and drums complemented by plinking piano, jangly guitars and Leithauser's unique vocal stylings. Two of the songs on the album, ""The Blizzard of '96"" and ""That's the Punchline,"" were adaptations of tracks meant for The Recoys' unreleased full-length album. 
Critics compared the results of the album to past work by U2 and The Cure as a result of the uniqueness of its sound as compared to other contemporary New York City bands such as The Strokes. One of the album's songs, ""We've Been Had,"" was featured in a commercial for a Saturn Ion automobile. 

Bows + Arrows:
The band's follow-up album, Bows + Arrows, was released on the Record Collection label in 2004 and was listed by many critics as one of the year's best albums. The album spawned singles for the songs ""The Rat"" and ""Little House of Savages."" Critical success of the album led the band to perform on the popular Fox series The O.C.Bows + Arrows was noted for containing a more immediate and focused sound than its predecessor; both ""The Rat"" and ""Little House of Savages"" were seen as stark contrasts to much of the band's past outputs. 

A Hundred Miles Off and Pussy Cats:
Their next album, A Hundred Miles Off, was released in the U.S. on May 23, 2006. The band premiered most of the new songs on a tour of the Northeast in early 2006. The first single to be released was ""Louisiana,"" which featured an upbeat chorus of horns. Peter Bauer and Walter Martin traded musical instruments on the new album, with Bauer handling the organ duties and Martin playing bass. The album found the band refocusing its sound toward folk sounds, unlike their previous two albums; though the change in direction was lauded by some critics, other reviews were often mixed. 
The band was forced to close Marcata Studios that same year after Columbia University purchased the building it resided in. The band released another full-length album, ""Pussy Cats"" Starring the Walkmen, a track-by-track cover of Harry Nilsson and John Lennon's 1974 album Pussy Cats, as a farewell to their studio's Harlem location. 

You & Me:
Their next studio album, You & Me, became available on July 29, 2008, as an exclusive charitable pre-release on indie music website Amie Street. The Walkmen made the album available for $5 on Amie Street, with all proceeds donated to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. During its first week of sales, the album charted at No. 29 on Billboard's Top Digital Albums. The album was made available on physical formats on August 19, 2008. The album was recorded at Gigantic Studios with Chris Zane. 

Lisbon:
The Walkmen recorded 13 songs for their latest album in five days in August 2009 with John Congleton and Chris Zane. They had been playing several of the songs since the summer of 2009. They recorded ""something like 28 songs,"" but included only 11 on the album. In support of the new album, The Walkmen performed at All Tomorrow Parties in May 2010, Lollapalooza in early August 2010, and the Reading and Leeds Festivals at the end of August 2010. Lisbon was released on September 14, 2010 on label Fat Possum records. Initial reviews have been favorable, with Pitchfork Media awarding the album 8.6/10, and PopMatters rating it 7/10. The band embarked on a fall tour of North America and Europe to support their new release. 

Heaven:
Pitchfork announced that Heaven would be out on June 4 (Europe/UK) and on June 5 (US). It was completed in early March, as mentioned by the band on their website on March 7, 2012. ""Hi everyone. Our album is finally done and we're thrilled with it. We can't wait to get it out there."" 
They released the song entitled ""Heaven"" to the public through Pitchfork Media's website on April 16, 2012, sparking the website to give the title ""Best New Track"" on the same day. 
The Walkmen toured in early 2012 for their 10th anniversary of Everyone Who Pretended to Like Me Is Gone, and during that tour they played many new songs. 
They released their album, Heaven, on May 29, 2012. Pitchfork rated it 8.1, and Stereogum called it the second best album of the year. American Songwriter says of The Walkmen that Heaven is ""arguably their best, and certainly most accomplished album yet."" Still in Rock gave the album a 7.8 rating and made a selection of the best tracks on the album. 
The music video for the album's tenth track, ""The Love You Love"", was shot at the infamous Baleroy Mansion in Philadelphia by the band who was looking for a haunted site. 
The song ""Heaven"" was also used as the closing song on the series finale of the hit CBS show How I Met Your Mother.]",0.384639727295,0.658301,"[indie rock, noise pop, lo-fi, garage rock, neo-psychedelic, dance-punk, indie pop, chamber pop, nu gaze, alternative rock, noise rock, freak folk, slow core, folk christmas, indie folk]",0.594864,0.00151695561509,0.118148134491,0.342903731096,0.738532531435,0.497756383385,4.0,0.152996345935,0.947936919421,1.0,0.0411580326053,0.953515431275,4.0,0.158382291647,1

He first gained world-wide recognition as the writing talent behind the popular American folk-rock duo Simon & Garfunkel formed with fellow musician Art Garfunkel. When Simon & Garfunkel split in 1970, Simon quickly began his solo career with the release of the self-titled album, Paul Simon. This was followed by There Goes Rhymin' Simon and Still Crazy After All These Years, both of which featured chart-topping hits such as Loves Me Like A Rock and Kodachrome. In 1986 Simon released the immensely popular Graceland, which featured the groundbreaking use of African rhythms and performers Ladysmith Black Mambazo. In 1990, he followed up Graceland with the successor album The Rhythm of the Saints which featured Brazilian and Cajun musical themes. These albums helped to popularize world music as a genre.  He co-wrote the unsuccessful, but critically-acclaimed musical The Capeman with Nobel-winning poet Derek Walcott in 1997. His most recent album, Surprise, was produced by Brian Eno.  Paul Simon still tours occasionally, both as a solo artist and with his old musical partner Art Garfunkel. He is married to Edie Brickell.

Simon's fame, influence, and commercial success began as part of the duo Simon & Garfunkel, formed in 1964 with musical partner Art Garfunkel. Simon wrote nearly all of the pair's songs, including three that reached No. 1 on the U.S. singles charts: ""The Sound of Silence"", ""Mrs. Robinson"", and ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"". The duo split up in 1970 at the height of their popularity, and Simon began a successful solo career as a guitarist and singer-songwriter, recording three highly acclaimed albums over the next five years. In 1986, he released Graceland, an album inspired by South African township music. Simon also wrote and starred in the film One-Trick Pony (1980) and co-wrote the Broadway musical The Capeman (1998) with the poet Derek Walcott. 
Simon has earned 12 Grammys for his solo and collaborative work, including the Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2001, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and in 2006 was selected as one of the ""100 People Who Shaped the World"" by Time magazine. In 2011, Rolling Stone magazine named Simon as one of the 100 Greatest Guitarists. Among many other honors, Simon was the first recipient of the Library of Congress's Gershwin Prize for Popular Song in 2007. In 1986, Simon was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Music degree from Berklee College of Music, where he currently serves on the Board of Trustees. 

Biography:

Early years:
Simon was born on October 13, 1941, in Newark, New Jersey, to Hungarian Jewish parents. His father Louis (1916-1995) was a college professor, upright bass player, and dance bandleader who performed under the name ""Lee Sims"". His mother, Belle (1910-2007), was an elementary school teacher. In 1945, his family moved to the Kew Gardens Hills section of Flushing, Queens, in New York City. The musician Donald Fagen has described Simon's childhood as that of ""a certain kind of New York Jew, almost a stereotype, really, to whom music and baseball are very important. I think it has to do with the parents. The parents are either immigrants or first-generation Americans who felt like outsiders, and assimilation was the key thought--they gravitated to black music and baseball looking for an alternative culture."" Simon, upon hearing Fagen's description, said it ""isn't far from the truth."" Simon says about his childhood, ""I was a ballplayer. I'd go on my bike, and I'd hustle kids in stickball."" He adds that his father was a New York Yankees fan: 

I used to listen to games with my father. He was a nice guy. Fun. Funny. Smart. He didn't play with me as much as I played with my kids. He was at work until late at night. ... Sometimes until two in the morning."" 

Simon's musical career began after meeting Art Garfunkel when they were both 11. They performed in a production of Alice in Wonderland for their sixth-grade graduation, and began singing together when they were 13, occasionally performing at school dances. Their idols were the Everly Brothers, whom they imitated in their use of close two-part harmony. Simon also developed an interest in jazz, folk, and blues, especially in the music of Woody Guthrie and Lead Belly. 
Simon's first song written for himself and Garfunkel, when Simon was 12 or 13, was called ""The Girl for Me,"" and according to Simon became the ""neighborhood hit."" His father wrote the words and chords on paper for the boys to use. That paper became the first officially copyrighted Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel song, and is now in the Library of Congress. In 1957, in their mid-teens, they recorded the song ""Hey, Schoolgirl"" under the name Tom & Jerry, given to them by their label Big Records. The single reached No. 49 on the pop charts. 
After graduating from Forest Hills High School, Simon majored in English at Queens College, while Garfunkel studied mathematics at Columbia University in Manhattan. Simon was a brother in the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity, earned a degree in English literature, and briefly attended Brooklyn Law School after graduation, but his real passion was rock and roll. 

Early career:
Between 1957 and 1964, Simon wrote, recorded, and released more than 30 songs, occasionally reuniting with Garfunkel as Tom & Jerry for some singles, including ""Our Song"" and ""That's My Story"". Most of the songs Simon recorded during that time were performed alone or with musicians other than Garfunkel. They were released on several minor record labels, such as Amy, Big, Hunt, King, Tribute, and Madison. He used several pseudonyms for these recordings, including Jerry Landis, Paul Kane, and True Taylor. Simon enjoyed some moderate success in recording a few singles as part of a group called Tico and the Triumphs, including a song called ""Motorcycle"" that reached No. 97 on the Billboard charts in 1962. Tico and the Triumphs released four 45s. Marty Cooper, known as Tico, sang lead on several of these releases. A childhood friend, Bobby Susser, children's songwriter, record producer, and performer, co-produced the Tico 45s with Simon. That year, Simon reached No. 99 on the pop charts as Jerry Landis with the novelty song ""The Lone Teen Ranger."" Both chart singles were released on Amy Records. 

Simon & Garfunkel:

In early 1964, Simon and Garfunkel got an audition with Columbia Records, whose executive Clive Davis was impressed enough to sign the duo to a contract to produce an album. Columbia decided that the two would be called simply ""Simon & Garfunkel,"" instead of the group's previous name ""Tom and Jerry."" Simon said in 2003 that this renaming as ""Simon & Garfunkel"" was the first time that artists' ethnic names had been used in pop music. Simon and Garfunkel's first LP, Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M., was released on October 19, 1964; it consisted of 12 songs in the folk vein, five written by Simon. The album initially flopped. 
Simon moved to England to pursue a solo career, touring folk clubs and coffee houses. At the first club he played, the Railway Inn Folk Club in Brentwood, Essex, he met Kathy Chitty who became his girlfriend and inspiration for ""Kathy's Song,"" ""America,"" and others. He performed at Les Cousins in London and toured provincial folk clubs that exposed him to a wide range of musical influences. In 1965, he recorded a solo LP The Paul Simon Songbook in England. 
While in the UK, Simon co-wrote several songs with Bruce Woodley of the Australian pop group the Seekers, including ""I Wish You Could Be Here,"" ""Cloudy,"" and ""Red Rubber Ball."" Woodley's co-author credit was omitted from ""Cloudy"" on the Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme album. The American group the Cyrkle recorded a cover of ""Red Rubber Ball"" that reached No. 2 in the U.S. Simon also contributed to the Seekers catalogue with ""Someday One Day,"" which was released in March 1966, charting around the same time as Simon and Garfunkel's ""Homeward Bound."" 
Back on the American East Coast, radio stations began receiving requests for one of the Wednesday Morning tracks, Simon's ""The Sound of Silence."" Their producer, Tom Wilson, overdubbed the track with electric guitar, bass guitar and drums, releasing it as a single that eventually went to No. 1 on the U.S. pop charts. 
The song's success drew Simon back to the United States to reunite with Garfunkel. Together they recorded four more influential albums: Sounds of Silence; Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme; Bookends; and the hugely successful Bridge over Troubled Water. Simon and Garfunkel also contributed extensively to the soundtrack of the Mike Nichols film The Graduate (1967), starring Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft. While writing ""Mrs. Robinson,"" Simon originally toyed with the title ""Mrs. Roosevelt"". When Garfunkel reported this indecision over the song's name to the director, Nichols replied, ""Don't be ridiculous! We're making a movie here! It's Mrs. Robinson!"" 
Simon and Garfunkel returned to England in the fall of 1968 and did a church concert appearance at Kraft Hall, which was broadcast on the BBC, and also featured Paul's brother Ed on a performance of the instrumental ""Anji."" 
Simon pursued solo projects after Bridge over Troubled Water, reuniting occasionally with Garfunkel for various projects, such as their 1975 Top Ten single ""My Little Town."" Simon wrote it for Garfunkel, whose solo output Simon judged as lacking ""bite."" The song was included on their respective solo albums--Paul Simon's Still Crazy After All These Years and Garfunkel's Breakaway. Contrary to popular belief, the song is not autobiographical of Simon's early life in New York City. In 1981, they reunited again for the famous concert in Central Park, followed by a world tour and an aborted reunion album, to have been entitled Think Too Much, which was eventually released (without Garfunkel) as Hearts and Bones. Together, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990. 
In 2003, Simon and Garfunkel reunited once again when they received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. This reunion led to a US tour--the acclaimed ""Old Friends"" concert series--followed by a 2004 international encore that culminated in a free concert at the Colosseum in Rome that drew 600,000 people. In 2005, the pair sang ""Mrs. Robinson"" and ""Homeward Bound,"" plus ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" with Aaron Neville, in the benefit concert From the Big Apple to The Big Easy - The Concert for New Orleans (eventually released as a DVD) for Hurricane Katrina victims. 
The pair reunited six years later in New Orleans at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival. 

1971-1976:
After Simon and Garfunkel split in 1970, Simon began to write and record solo material. His album Paul Simon was released in January 1972, preceded by his first experiment with world music, the Jamaican-inspired ""Mother and Child Reunion,"" considered one of the first examples of reggae by a white musician. The single was a hit, reaching both the American and British Top 5. The album received universal acclaim, with critics praising the variety of styles and the confessional lyrics, reaching No. 4 in the U.S. and No. 1 in the UK and Japan. It later spawned another Top 30 hit with ""Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard"". 
Simon's next project was the pop-folk album, There Goes Rhymin' Simon, released in May 1973. It contained some of his most popular and polished recordings. The lead single, ""Kodachrome,"" was a No. 2 hit in America, and the follow-up, the gospel-flavored ""Loves Me Like a Rock"" was even bigger, topping the Cashbox charts. Other songs like the weary ""American Tune"" or the melancholic ""Something So Right"" -- a tribute to Simon's first wife, Peggy, which received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Song of the Year -- became standards in the musician's catalog. Critical and commercial reception for this second album was even stronger than for his debut. At the time, reviewers noted how the songs were fresh and unworried on the surface, while still exploring socially and politically conscious themes on a deeper level. The album reached No. 1 on the Cashbox album charts. As a souvenir for the tour that came next, in 1974 it was released as a live album, Live Rhymin', which was moderately successful and displayed some changes in Simon's music style, adopting world and religious music. 
Highly anticipated, Still Crazy After All These Years was his next album. Released in October 1975 and produced by Simon and Phil Ramone, it marked another departure. The mood of the album was darker, as he wrote and recorded it in the wake of his divorce. Preceded by the feel-good duet with Phoebe Snow, ""Gone at Last"" (a Top 25 hit) and the Simon & Garfunkel reunion track ""My Little Town"" (a No. 9 on Billboard), the album was his only No. 1 on the Billboard charts to date. The 18th Grammy Awards named it the Album of the Year and Simon's performance the year's Best Male Pop Vocal. With Simon in the forefront of popular music, the third single from the album, ""50 Ways to Leave Your Lover"" reached the top spot of the Billboard charts, his only single to reach No. 1 on this list. Also, on May 3, 1976, Simon put together a benefit show at Madison Square Garden to raise money for the New York Public Library. Phoebe Snow, Jimmy Cliff and the Brecker Brothers also performed. The concert produced over $30,000 for the Library. 

1977-1985:
After three successful studio albums, Simon became less productive during the second half of the 1970s. He dabbled in various projects, including writing music for the film Shampoo, which became the music for the song ""Silent Eyes"" on the ""Still Crazy"" album, and acting (he was cast as Tony Lacey in Woody Allen's film Annie Hall). He achieved another hit in this decade, with the lead single of his 1977 compilation, Greatest Hits, Etc., ""Slip Slidin' Away,"" reaching No. 5 in the United States. 
In 1980 he released One-Trick Pony, his debut album with Warner Bros. Records and his first in almost five years. It was paired with the motion picture of the same name, which Simon wrote and starred in. Although it produced his last Top 10 hit with the upbeat ""Late in the Evening"" (also a No. 1 hit on the Radio & Records American charts), the album did not sell well, in a music market dominated by disco music. Simon recorded Hearts and Bones, a polished and confessional album that was eventually viewed as one of his best works, but that marked a lull in his commercial popularity; both the album and the lead single, ""Allergies,"" missed the American Top 40. Hearts and Bones included ""The Late Great Johnny Ace,"" a song partly about Johnny Ace, an American R&B singer, and partly about slain Beatle John Lennon. A successful U.S. solo tour featured Simon and his guitar, with a recording of the rhythm track and horns for ""Late In The Evening."" In January 1985, Simon lent his talent to USA for Africa and performed on the relief fundraising single ""We Are the World."" 

1986-1992:
As he commented years later, after the disappointing commercial performance of Hearts and Bones, Simon felt he had lost his inspiration to a point of no return, and that his commercial fortunes were unlikely to change. While driving his car in late 1984 in this state of frustration, Simon listened to a cassette of the Boyoyo Boys' instrumental ""Gumboots: Accordion Jive Volume II"" which had been lent to him by Heidi Berg, a singer songwriter he was working with at the time. Lorne Michaels had introduced Paul to Heidi when Heidi was working as the bandleader for Lorne's ""The New Show"". Interested by the unusual sound, he wrote lyrics to the number, which he sang over a re-recording of the song. It was the first composition of a new musical project that became the celebrated album Graceland, an eclectic mixture of musical styles including pop, a cappella, isicathamiya, rock, zydeco and mbaqanga. Simon felt that he had nothing to lose. He went to South Africa in an attempt to embrace the culture and find the most comfortable environment for recording the album. Sessions in Johannesburg took place in February 1985. Overdubbing and additional recording was done in April 1986, in New York. The sessions featured many South African musicians and groups, particularly Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Simon also collaborated with several American artists, singing a memorable duet with Linda Ronstadt in ""Under African Skies,"" and playing with Los Lobos in ""All Around the World or The Myth of the Fingerprints."" 
Warner Bros. Records had serious doubts about releasing such an eclectic album to the mainstream, but did so in August 1986. Graceland was praised by critics and the public, and became Simon's most successful solo album. Slowly climbing the worldwide charts, it reached #1 in many countries, including the UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand--and peaked at #3 in the U.S. It was the second-best-selling album of 1987 in the US, selling five million copies and eventually reaching 5x Platinum certification. Another seven million copies sold internationally, making it his best-selling album. Much of the success of the album was due to the lead single, the upbeat ""You Can Call Me Al,"" whose lyrics describe a man experiencing an identity crisis. The track featured many memorable elements--a catchy synthesizer riff (played by Adrian Belew of King Crimson], an easy whistle solo, and an unusual bass run, in which the second half was a reversed recording of the first half. ""You Can Call Me Al"" was accompanied by a humorous video featuring actor Chevy Chase, which introduced Simon to a new audience through MTV. In the end, the track reached UK Top 5 and the U.S. Top 25. Further singles, including the title track, ""The Boy in the Bubble"" and ""Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes,"" were not commercial hits but became radio standards and were highly praised. 
At age 45, Simon found himself back at the forefront of popular music. He received the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1987 and also Grammy Award for Record of the Year for the title track one year later. He also embarked on the very successful Graceland Tour, which was documented on music video. Simon found himself embracing new sounds, which some critics viewed negatively--however, Simon reportedly felt it was a natural artistic experiment, considering that world music was already present on much of his early work, including such Simon & Garfunkel hits as ""El Condor Pasa"" and his early solo recording ""Mother and Child Reunion,"" which was recorded in Kingston, Jamaica. One way or another, Warner Bros. Records (who by this time controlled and reissued all his previous Columbia albums) re-established Simon as one of their most successful artists. In an attempt to capitalize on his renewed success, WB Records released the album Negotiations and Love Songs in November 1988, a mixture of popular hits and personal favorites that covered Simon's entire career and became an enduring seller in his catalog. 
After Graceland, Simon decided to extend his roots with the Brazilian music-flavored The Rhythm of the Saints. Sessions for the album began in December 1989, and took place in Rio de Janeiro and New York, featuring guitarist JJ Cale and many Brazilian and African musicians. The tone of the album was more introspective and relatively low-key compared to the mostly upbeat numbers of Graceland. Released on October 1990, the album received excellent critical reviews and achieved very respectable sales, peaking at #4 in the U.S. and No. 1 in the UK. The lead single, ""The Obvious Child,"" featuring the Grupo Cultural Olodum, became his last Top 20 hit in the UK and appeared near the bottom of the Billboard Hot 100. Although not as successful as Graceland, The Rhythm of the Saints was received as a competent successor and consistent complement on Simon's attempts to explore (and popularize) world music, and also received a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year. 
Simon's ex-wife Carrie Fisher says in her autobiography Wishful Drinking that the song ""She Moves On"" is about her. It's one of several she claims, followed by the line, ""If you can get Paul Simon to write a song about you, do it. Because he is so brilliant at it.""  
The success of both albums allowed Simon to stage another New York concert. On August 15, 1991, almost a decade after his concert with Garfunkel, Simon staged a second concert in Central Park with African and South American bands. The success of the concert surpassed all expectations, and reportedly over 750,000 people attended--one of the largest concert audiences in history. He later remembered the concert as, ""...the most memorable moment in my career."" The success of the show led to both a live album and an Emmy-winning TV special. In the middle, Simon embarked on the successful Born at the Right Time Tour, and promoted the album with further singles, including ""Proof""--accompanied with a humorous video that again featured Chevy Chase, and added Steve Martin. On March 4, 1992, he appeared on his own MTV Unplugged, offering renditions of many of his most famous compositions. Broadcast in June, the show was a success, though it did not receive an album release. 

1993-1998:
After Unplugged, Simon's place in the forefront of popular music dropped notably. A Simon & Garfunkel reunion took place in September 1993, and in another attempt to capitalize on the occasion, Columbia released Paul Simon 1964/1993 in September, a three-disc compilation that received a reduced version on the two-disc album The Paul Simon Anthology one month later. In 1995 he made news for appearing on The Oprah Winfrey Show, where he performed the song ""Ten Years,"" which he composed specially for the tenth anniversary of the show. Also that year, he was featured on the Annie Lennox version of his 1973 song ""Something So Right,"" which appeared briefly on the UK Top 50 once it was released as a single in November. 
Since the early stages of the nineties, Simon was fully involved on The Capeman, a musical that finally opened on January 29, 1998. Simon worked enthusiastically on the project for many years and described it as ""a New York Puerto Rican story based on events that happened in 1959--events that I remembered.""  The musical tells the story of real-life Puerto Rican youth Salvador Agron, who wore a cape while committing two murders in 1959 New York, and went on to become a writer in prison. Featuring Marc Anthony as the young Agron and Rubén Blades as the older Agron, the play received terrible reviews and very poor box office receipts from the very beginning, and closed on March 28 after just 68 performances--a failure that reportedly cost Simon 11 million dollars. 
Simon recorded an album of songs from the show, which was released in November 1997. It was received with very mixed reviews, though many critics praised the combination of doo-wop, rockabilly and Caribbean music that the album reflected. In commercial terms, Songs from The Capeman was a failure--it found Simon missing the Top 40 of the Billboard charts for the first time in his career. The cast album was never released on CD but eventually became available online. 

1999-2007:
After the disaster of The Capeman, Simon's career was again in an unexpected crisis. However, entering the new millennium, he maintained a respectable reputation, offering critically acclaimed new material and receiving commercial attention. In 1999, Simon embarked on a North American tour with Bob Dylan, where each alternated as headline act with a ""middle"" section where they performed together, starting on the first of June and ending September 18. The collaboration was generally well-received, with just one critic, Seth Rogovoy, from the Berkshire Eagle, questioning the collaboration. 
In an attempt to return successfully to the music market, Simon wrote and recorded a new album very quickly, with You're the One arriving in October 2000. The album consisted mostly of folk-pop writing combined with foreign musical sounds, particularly grooves from North Africa. While not reaching the commercial heights of previous albums, it managed at least to reach both the British and American Top 20. It received favorable reviews and received a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year. He toured extensively for the album, and one performance in Paris was released to home video. 
On September 21, 2001, Simon sang ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" on ""America: A Tribute to Heroes,"" a multinetwork broadcast to benefit the September 11 Telethon Fund. In 2002, he wrote and recorded ""Father and Daughter,"" the theme song for the animated family film The Wild Thornberrys Movie, The track was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Song. In 2003, he participated on another Simon & Garfunkel reunion. One year later, Simon's studio albums were re-released both individually and together in a limited-edition nine-CD boxed set, Paul Simon: The Studio Recordings 1972-2000. 
At the time, Simon was already working on a new album with Brian Eno called Surprise, which was released in May 2006. Most of the album was inspired by the September 11 terrorist attacks, the Iraq invasion, and the war that followed. In personal terms, Simon was also inspired by the fact of having turned 60 in 2001, which he humorously referred to on ""Old"" from You're the One. 
Simon showed special care about the musical venture he traveled since 1986's Graceland. As he put it, ""Once you go away for a bit, you wonder who people think you are. If they don't know what you're up to, they just go by your history. I'm so often described as this person that went to other cultures, which is true, but I never thought of it that way. I suspect people are thinking, 'What culture did you go to?' But this record is straight-ahead American."" 
Surprise was a commercial hit, reaching #14 in the Billboard 200 and #4 in the UK. Most critics also praised the album, and many of them called it a ""comeback"". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic wrote that ""Simon doesn't achieve his comeback by reconnecting with the sound and spirit of his classic work; he has achieved it by being as restless and ambitious as he was at his popular and creative peak, which makes Surprise all the more remarkable."" The album was supported with the successful Surprise Tour. 

On March 1, 2007, Simon made headlines again when the Library of Congress announced that he would be the first recipient of the recently created Gershwin Prize for Popular Song. Simon received the prize during a concert gala at the Warner Theatre in Washington, D.C., on the evening of May 23. The event featured his music, and was nationally broadcast on PBS on the evening of June 27, 2007. Performers at the concert included Shawn Colvin, Philip Glass, Alison Krauss, Jerry Douglas, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Lyle Lovett, James Taylor, Stevie Wonder, and Simon's former partner Art Garfunkel. On June 26, Warner Bros. released the definitive Paul Simon greatest-hits collection. The Essential Paul Simon consisted of two discs that reviewed 36 songs from his ten studio albums, and was also released on a special edition featuring a DVD of music videos and memorable live performances. The album was a commercial hit, reaching #12 in the UK. 

2008-2013:
After living in Montauk, New York, for many years, Simon relocated to New Canaan, Connecticut. 
Simon is one of a small number of performers who are named as the copyright owner on their recordings (most records have the recording company as the named owner of the recording). This noteworthy development was spearheaded by the Bee Gees after their successful $200 million lawsuit against RSO Records, which remains the largest successful lawsuit against a record company by an artist or group. All of Simon's solo recordings, including those originally issued by Columbia Records, are currently distributed by Sony Records' Legacy Recordings unit. His albums were issued by Warner Music until mid-2010. In mid-2010, Simon moved his catalog of solo work from Warner Bros. Records to Sony/Columbia Records  where Simon and Garfunkel's catalog is. Simon's back catalog of solo recordings would be marketed by Sony Music's Legacy Recordings unit. 
In February 2009, Simon performed back-to-back shows in New York City at the Beacon Theatre, which had recently been renovated. Simon was reunited with Art Garfunkel at the first show as well as with the cast of The Capeman; also playing in the band was Graceland bassist Bakithi Kumalo. In May 2009, Simon toured with Garfunkel in Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. In October 2009, they appeared together at the 25th Anniversary of The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame concert at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The pair performed four of their most popular songs, ""The Sound of Silence,"" ""The Boxer,"" ""Cecilia,"" and ""Bridge Over Troubled Water."" 

Simon's album So Beautiful or So What was released on the Concord Music Group label on April 12, 2011. The album received high marks from the artist, ""It's the best work I've done in 20 years."" It was reported that Simon attempted to have Bob Dylan guest on the album. 
On November 10, 2010, Simon released a new song called ""Getting Ready for Christmas Day"". It premiered on National Public Radio, and was included on the album So Beautiful Or So What. The song samples a 1941 sermon by the Rev. J.M. Gates, also entitled ""Getting Ready for Christmas Day"". Simon performed the song live on The Colbert Report on December 16, 2010. The first video featured J.M. Gates' giving the sermon and his church in 2010 with its display board showing many of Simon's lyrics; the second video illustrates the song with cartoon images. 
In the premiere show of the final season of The Oprah Winfrey Show on September 10, 2010, Simon surprised Oprah and the audience with a song dedicated to Oprah and her show lasting 25 years (an update of a song he did for her show's 10th anniversary). 
Rounding off his 2011 World Tour, which included United States, England, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Germany, Simon appeared at Ramat Gan Stadium in Israel in July 2011, making his first concert appearance in Israel since 1983. On September 11, 2011, Paul Simon performed ""The Sound of Silence"" at the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, site of the World Trade Center, on the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks. 
On February 26, 2012, Simon paid tribute to fellow musicians Chuck Berry and Leonard Cohen who were the recipients of the first annual PEN Awards for songwriting excellence at the JFK Presidential Library in Boston, Massachusetts. In 1986 Simon was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Music degree from Berklee College of Music where he currently serves on the Board of Trustees. 
On June 5, 2012, Simon released a 25th anniversary box set of Graceland, which included a remastered edition of the original album, the documentary film Under African Skies, the original 1987 ""African Concert"" from Zimbabwe, an audio narrative ""The Story of 'Graceland'"" as told by Paul Simon, and other interviews and paraphernalia. He played a few concerts in Europe with the original musicians to commemorate the anniversary. 
On December 19, 2012, Simon performed at the funeral of Victoria Leigh Soto, a teacher killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. 
On June 14, 2013, at Sting's Back to Bass Tour, Simon performed his song ""The Boxer"" and Sting's ""Fields of Gold"" with Sting. 
In September 2013, Simon delivered the Richard Ellmann Lectures in Modern Literature at Emory University. 

2014-present:
In February 2014, Simon embarked on the On Stage Together Tour with English musician Sting, playing 21 concerts in North America. The tour will continue in early 2015, with ten shows in Australia and New Zealand and 23 concerts in Europe, ending on 18 April 2015. 

Songwriting:
In an in-depth interview reprinted in American Songwriter, Simon discusses the craft of songwriting with music journalist Tom Moon. In the interview, Simon explains the basic themes in his songwriting: love, family, social commentary, etc., as well as the overarching messages of religion, spirituality, and God in his lyrics. Simon goes on in the interview to explain the process of how he goes about writing songs, ""The music always precedes the words. The words often come from the sound of the music and eventually evolve into coherent thoughts. Or incoherent thoughts. Rhythm plays a crucial part in the lyric-making as well. It's like a puzzle to find the right words to express what the music is saying."" 

Projects:

Music for Broadway:
In the late 1990s, Simon wrote and produced a Broadway musical called The Capeman, which lost $11 million during its 1998 run. In April 2008, the Brooklyn Academy of Music celebrated Paul Simon's works, and dedicated a week to Songs From the Capeman with a good portion of the show's songs performed by a cast of singers and the Spanish Harlem Orchestra. Simon himself appeared during the BAM shows, performing ""Trailways Bus"" and ""Late In the Evening"". In August 2010, The Capeman was staged for three nights in the Delacorte Theatre in New York's Central Park. The production was directed by Diane Paulus and produced in conjunction with the Public Theater. 

Film and television:
Simon has also dabbled in acting. He played music producer Tony Lacey, a supporting character, in the 1977 Woody Allen feature film Annie Hall. He wrote and starred in 1980's One Trick Pony as Jonah Levin, a journeyman rock and roller. Simon also wrote all the songs in the film. Paul Simon also appeared on The Muppet Show (the only episode to use only the songs of one songwriter, Simon). In 1990, he played the character of--appropriately enough--Simple Simon on the Disney Channel TV movie, Mother Goose Rock 'n' Rhyme. 
In 1978, Simon made a cameo in the movie, The Rutles: All You Need Is Cash. 
He has been the subject of two films by Jeremy Marre, the first on Graceland, the second on The Capeman. 
On November 18, 2008, Simon was a guest on The Colbert Report promoting his book Lyrics 1964-2008. After an interview with Stephen Colbert, Simon performed ""American Tune"". 
Simon performed a Stevie Wonder song at the White House in 2009 at an event honoring Wonder's musical career and contributions. 
In May 2009, The Library of Congress: Paul Simon and Friends Live Concert was released on DVD, via Shout! Factory. The PBS concert was recorded in 2007. 
In April 2011 Simon was confirmed to appear at the Glastonbury music festival in England. 

Saturday Night Live:
Simon has appeared on Saturday Night Live (SNL), either as host or musical guest, 14 times. On one appearance in the late 1980s, he worked with his political namesake, Illinois Senator Paul Simon. Simon's most recent SNL appearance on a Saturday night was on the March 9, 2013 episode hosted by Justin Timberlake as a member of the Five-Timers Club. In one SNL skit from 1986 (when he was promoting Graceland), Simon plays himself, waiting in line with a friend to get into a movie. He amazes his friend by remembering intricate details about prior meetings with passers-by, but draws a complete blank when approached by Art Garfunkel, despite the latter's numerous memory prompts. Simon appeared alongside George Harrison as musical guest on the Thanksgiving Day episode of SNL (November 20, 1976). The two performed ""Here Comes the Sun"" and ""Homeward Bound"" together, while Simon performed ""50 Ways to Leave Your Lover"" solo earlier in the show. On that episode, Simon opened the show performing ""Still Crazy After All These Years"" in a turkey outfit, since Thanksgiving was the following week. About halfway through the song, Simon tells the band to stop playing because of his embarrassment. After giving a frustrating speech to the audience, he leaves the stage, backed by applause. Lorne Michaels positively greets him backstage, but Simon is still upset, yelling at him because of the humiliating turkey outfit. This is one of SNL‍ '​s most played sketches. Simon closed the 40th anniversary SNL show on February 15, 2015, with a performance of ""Still Crazy After All These Years,"" sans turkey outfit. Simon also played a snippet of ""I've Just Seen a Face"" with Sir Paul McCartney during the special's introductory sequence. 
On September 29, 2001, Simon made a special appearance on the first SNL to air after the September 11, 2001 attacks. On that show, he performed ""The Boxer"" to the audience and the NYC firefighters and police officers. He is also a friend of former SNL star Chevy Chase, who appeared in his video for ""You Can Call Me Al"" lip synching the song while Simon looks disgruntled and mimes backing vocals and the playing of various instruments beside him. Chase would also appear in Simon's 1991 video for the song ""Proof"" alongside Steve Martin. He is a close friend of SNL producer Lorne Michaels, who produced the 1977 TV show The Paul Simon Special, as well as the Simon and Garfunkel concert in Central Park four years later. Simon and Lorne Michaels were the subjects of a 2006 episode of the Sundance channel documentary series, Iconoclasts. 

Awards and honors:

Simon has won 12 Grammy Awards (one of them a Lifetime Achievement Award) and five Album of the Year Grammy nominations, the most recent for You're the One in 2001. In 1998 he received a Grammy Hall of Fame Award for the Simon & Garfunkel album Bridge Over Troubled Water. He received an Oscar nomination for the song ""Father and Daughter"" in 2002. He is also a two-time inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame; as a solo artist in 2001, and in 1990 as half of Simon & Garfunkel. 
In 2001, Simon was honored as MusiCares Person Of The Year. The following year, he was one of the five recipients of the annual Kennedy Center Honors, the nation's highest tribute to performing and cultural artists. In 2005, Simon was saluted as a BMI Icon at the 53rd Annual BMI Pop Awards. Simon's songwriting catalog has earned 39 BMI Awards including multiple citations for ""Bridge Over Troubled Water,"" ""Mrs. Robinson,"" ""Scarborough Fair"" and ""The Sound of Silence"". As of 2005, he has amassed nearly 75 million broadcast airplays, according to BMI surveys. 
In 2006, Simon was selected by Time Magazine as one of the ""100 People Who Shaped the World."" 
In 2007, Simon received the first annual Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song. (Stevie Wonder and Paul McCartney followed in 2009 and 2010.) Named in honor of George and Ira Gershwin, this new award recognizes the profound and positive effect of popular music on the world's culture. On being notified of the honor, Simon said, ""I am grateful to be the recipient of the Gershwin Prize and doubly honored to be the first. I look forward to spending an evening in the company of artists I admire at the award ceremony in May. I can think of a few who have expressed my words and music far better than I. I'm excited at the prospect of that happening again. It's a songwriter's dream come true."" Among the performers who paid tribute to Simon were Stevie Wonder, Alison Krauss, Jerry Douglas, Lyle Lovett, James Taylor, Dianne Reeves, Marc Anthony, Yolanda Adams, and Ladysmith Black Mambazo. The event was professionally filmed and broadcast and is now available as Paul Simon and Friends. 
In 2010, Simon received an honorary degree from Brandeis University, where he performed ""The Boxer"" at the main commencement ceremony. 
In October 2011, Simon was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Science. At the induction ceremony, he performed ""American Tune."" 
In 2012, Simon was awarded the Polar Music Prize. 

Personal life:
When Simon moved to England in 1964, he met Kathleen Mary ""Kathy"" Chitty (born 1947) on April 12, 1964, at the first English folk club he played, the Hermit Club in Brentwood, Essex, where Chitty worked part-time selling tickets. She was 17, he was 22, and they fell in love. Later that year they visited the U.S. together, touring around mainly by bus. Kathy returned to England on her own with Simon returning to her some weeks later. When Simon returned to the U.S. with the growing success of ""The Sound of Silence"", Kathy, who was quite shy wanted no part of the success and fame that awaited Simon and they split. She is mentioned by name in at least two of his songs: ""Kathy's Song"" and ""America,"" and is referred to in ""Homeward Bound"" and ""The Late Great Johnny Ace."" There is a photo of Simon and Kathy on the cover of The Paul Simon Songbook. 
Simon has been married three times, first to Peggy Harper in late autumn 1969. They had son Harper Simon in 1972 and divorced in 1975. The song ""Train in the Distance,"" from Simon's 1983 album Hearts and Bones, is about this relationship. Simon's 1972 song ""Run That Body Down,"" from his second solo album, casually mentions both himself and his then-wife (""Peg"") by name. 
His second marriage, from 1983 to 1984, was to actress and author Carrie Fisher to whom he proposed after a New York Yankees game. The song ""Hearts and Bones"" was written about this relationship. The song ""Graceland"" is also thought to be about seeking solace from the end of this relationship by taking a road trip. A year after divorcing, Simon and Fisher resumed their relationship for several years. 
His third wife is folk singer Edie Brickell whom he married on May 30, 1992. They have three children: Adrian, Lulu, and Gabriel. 
Paul Simon and his younger brother, Eddie Simon, founded the Guitar Study Center in New York City. The Guitar Study Center later became part of The New School in New York City. 

Philanthropy:
Simon is a proponent of music education for children. In 1970, after recording his ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"", at the invitation of the NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, Simon held auditions for a young songwriter's workshop. Advertised in the Village Voice, the auditions brought hundreds of hopefuls to perform for Simon. Among the six teenage songwriters Simon selected for tutelage were Melissa Manchester, Tommy Mandel and rock/beat poet Joe Linus, with Maggie and Terre Roche (the Roche Sisters), who later sang back-up for Simon, joining the workshop in progress through an impromptu appearance. 
Simon invited the six teens to experience recording at Columbia studios with engineer Roy Halee at the board. During these sessions, Bob Dylan was downstairs recording the album Self-Portrait, which included a version of Simon's ""The Boxer"". Violinist Isaac Stern also visited the group with a CBS film crew, speaking to the young musicians about lyrics and music after Joe Linus performed his song ""Circus Lion"" for Stern. 
Manchester later paid homage to Simon, on her recorded song, ""Ode to Paul."" Other younger musicians Simon has mentored include Nick Laird-Clowes, who later co-founded the band the Dream Academy. Laird-Clowes has credited Simon with helping to shape the band's biggest hit, ""Life in a Northern Town"". 
In 2003, Simon signed on as an official supporter of Little Kids Rock, a nonprofit organization that provides free musical instruments and free lessons to children in public schools throughout the U.S. He sits on the organization's board of directors as an honorary member. 
Simon is also a major benefactor and one of the co-founders, with Dr. Irwin Redlener, of the Children's Health Project and The Children's Health Fund which started by creating specially equipped ""buses"" to take medical care to children in medically underserved areas, urban and rural. Their first bus was in the impoverished South Bronx of New York City, but they now operate in 12 states, including on the Gulf Coast. It has expanded greatly, partnering with major hospitals, local public schools and medical schools and advocating policy for children's health and medical care. 
In May 2012, Paul Simon performed at a benefit dinner for the Turkana Basin Institute in New York City, raising more than $2 million for Richard Leakey's research institute in Africa.]",0.397473272767,0.773868,"[singer-songwriter, folk rock, folk-pop, folk, traditional folk, mellow gold, folk christmas, roots rock, permanent wave, soft rock]",0.785033,0.639246867195,0.729939765536,0.373033272864,0.690819061224,0.000468515257301,1.0,0.0796643322107,0.680276517606,0.0,0.033910297666,0.749831508539,4.0,0.868158341751,1

The band consists of Charles (Black Francis) Thompson IV (vocals, guitar; also known as ''Frank Black''), Joey Santiago (lead guitar) and David Lovering (drums). Until 2013, the band also featured  Kim Deal on bass and vocals. The band officially split in 1993  and reunited in 2004. They went on hiatus in 2007, with each band member pursuing projects of their own, only to reunite in 2009, with the announcement of a new tour commencing in Europe that summer.  Although quite popular on alternative rock radio in the United States due to heavy airplay of the singles ""Monkey Gone to Heaven"" and ""Here Comes Your Man"", they were never widely popular there, but found success in Europe, especially in the UK (where they managed three top 40 singles ""Velouria"", ""Planet of Sound"" and a re-release of ""Debaser"") and Belgium and the Netherlands, where they were heavily broadcasted by alternative public radio.   The band's style of alternative rock music is heavily influenced by punk and surf rock, and while highly melodic, is capable of being tremendously abrasive at the same time. Francis is the Pixies' primary songwriter and singer and has a distinctly desperate, yowling delivery. He has typically written cryptic songs about offbeat subjects, such as UFOs and surrealism. References to mental instability, violent Biblical imagery, and physical injury feature in many of the band's songs.  The group is frequently posited as the immediate forebear of the alternative rock boom of the 1990s, though they disbanded before reaping any of the benefits this might have brought them. Avowed fan Kurt Cobain's acknowledgement of the debt Nirvana owed to the Pixies, along with similar tributes by other alternative bands, ensured that the Pixies' legacy and influence grew substantially in the years following their demise.  In 1993, during an interview with BBC Radio 5, Black Francis announced that the band had split - something he had not told his bandmates. After the interview, he called Santiago, who in turn faxed Deal and Lovering the news the next morning. After the split, Black Francis inverted his stage name to Frank Black and embarked on a successful solo career, while Deal resumed her role in The Breeders with her identical twin sister Kelley. In 2004, the band reunited for a tour - documented in the film loudQUIETloud - and released a new single, ""Bam Thwok"" that summer. In 2007, Black Francis (now going by that name again) stated in an interview that the reunion was ""done"" even though the members remain in good terms with each other. In later interviews however, he began to mention that he might be willing to record another Pixies album. Nonetheless, Francis has returned to his solo career and Deal to the Breeders, both of which released albums and toured in 2008. Lovering and Santiago, meanwhile, set up their own project, a band called Everybody.  In order to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the release of Doolittle, Pixies launched a tour in October 2009, on which they perform all the album's songs and B-sides. In the autumn of 2011 the ""Lost Cities"" tour continued the ""Doolittle Tour"" as they played many venues for the first time., Combining jagged, roaring guitars and stop-start dynamics with melodic pop ..., ......, Led by Black Francis (AKA Charles Thompson), this Boston band ..., As the rock underground slouched towards mainstream acceptance in the ..., Combining jagged, roaring guitars and stop-start dynamics with melodic pop ..., Led by Black Francis (AKA Charles Thompson), this Boston band ..., Combining jagged, roaring guitars and stop-start dynamics with melodic pop ..., Beloved and enigmatic, influential and proudly difficult to categorize, the ..., The Pixies are an American rock band formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1986. The group currently consists of founders Black Francis (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Joey Santiago (lead guitar), and David Lovering (drums). Co-founder Kim Deal (bass, backing vocals) left in 2013 and was replaced by Kim Shattuck as live bass player for a few months, then by Paz Lenchantin for the band's 2014 tour. The Pixies achieved relatively modest popularity in their home country, but were significantly more successful in the United Kingdom, mainland Europe and Israel. The group disbanded in 1993 in acrimonious circumstances, but reunited in 2004. Despite limited commercial success, their jarring pop sound subsequently influenced bands such as Nirvana, Radiohead, The Strokes, Bush, Blur and Weezer. 
The band's style of music contains a range of elements, including psychedelia, noise pop, hard rock, surf pop, and surf rock. Black Francis is the Pixies' primary songwriter and singer. He has written about a number of offbeat subjects in the band's songs, such as extraterrestrials, surrealism, incest, and biblical violence. 
The group is credited with having an influence on the alternative rock boom of the 1990s. The Pixies' legacy and popularity grew in the years following their break-up, leading to sold-out world tours following their reunion in 2004. In June 2013, the band released their first new material in almost 10 years. 

History:

Formation (1986):

Joey Santiago and Black Francis (born Charles Thompson IV) first met when they lived next to each other in a suite while attending the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Although Santiago was worried about distractions, he noticed Francis played music and the pair began to jam together. Francis then embarked on a student exchange trip to Puerto Rico to study Spanish. After six months, he returned to Amherst and dropped out of the university. Francis and Santiago spent 1984 working in a warehouse, with Francis composing songs on his acoustic guitar and writing lyrics on the subway train. 
Black Francis didn't discover punk until he was 16, saying ""it was good I didn't listen to these hip records."" He started out on a diet of 60's songs, religious music and Emerson Lake and Palmer, then Iggy Pop, Husker Du, Captain Beefheart and Talking Heads, who he says ""weren't punk either"". 
The pair formed a band in January 1986. Bass player Kim Deal joined Santiago and Francis two weeks later after responding to a classified advertisement Francis had placed, seeking a female bass player who liked both folk music icons Peter, Paul and Mary and the band Hüsker Dü. Deal was the only person to respond, but arrived at the audition without a bass as she had never played the instrument before. She was invited to join the band just because she liked the songs Black Francis was showing her. She later obtained a bass, and the trio started rehearsing in Deal's apartment. 
After recruiting Deal, the band tried unsuccessfully to get her sister, Kelley Deal, to join as its drummer. Kim's husband suggested they hire drummer David Lovering, whom Kim had met at her wedding reception. The group arrived at a name after Santiago selected the word ""pixies"" randomly from a dictionary and took a liking to how it looked and its definition as ""mischievous little elves"". Once the band had settled on a name and stable line-up, they moved rehearsals to Lovering's parents' garage in mid-1986. They began to play shows at bars in and around the Boston area. 

Record contract and Come On Pilgrim (1987):
While the Pixies were playing a concert with Throwing Muses, they were noticed by producer Gary Smith, manager of Fort Apache Studios. He told the band he ""could not sleep until you guys are world famous"". The band produced a 17-track demo at Fort Apache soon afterwards, known to fans as ""The Purple Tape"" because of the tape cover's purple background. Funded by Francis' father at the cost of $1000, the recording session was completed in three days. Local promoter Ken Goes became the band's manager, and he passed the demo to Ivo Watts-Russell of the independent record label 4AD. Watts-Russell nearly passed on the band, finding them too normal, ""too rock 'n' roll"", but signed them at the persuasion of his girlfriend. 
Upon signing with 4AD, eight tracks from the Purple Tape were selected for the Come On Pilgrim mini-LP, the band's first release. On it, Francis drew upon his experiences in Puerto Rico, mostly in the songs ""Vamos"" and ""Isla de Encanta""; the album included lyrics describing the poverty in Puerto Rico. The religious lyrics in Come On Pilgrim and later albums came from his parents' born-again Christian days in the Pentecostal Church. Critic Heather Phares sees themes such as sexual frustration (""I've Been Tired"") and incest (""Nimrod's Son"" and ""The Holiday Song"") on the record. 

Surfer Rosa and Doolittle (1988-89):
Come On Pilgrim was followed by the band's first full-length album, Surfer Rosa. The album was recorded by Steve Albini (who was hired by Watts-Russell on the advice of a 4AD colleague), completed in two weeks, and released in early 1988.Surfer Rosa gained the Pixies acclaim in Europe; both Melody Maker and Sounds gave Surfer Rosa their ""Album of the Year"" award. American critical response was also positive yet more muted, a reaction that persisted for much of the band's career. The album was eventually certified Gold in the U.S. in 2005. After the album was released, the band arrived in England to support Throwing Muses on the European ""Sex and Death"" tour--beginning at the Mean Fiddler in London. The tour also took them to the Netherlands, where the Pixies had already received enough media attention to be headlining the tour. Francis later recalled: ""The first place I made it with the Pixies was in Holland."" The tour became notable for the band's in-jokes, such as playing their entire set list in alphabetical order. 
Meanwhile, the Pixies signed an American distribution deal with major record label Elektra. Around this time, the Pixies struck up a relationship with the British producer Gil Norton. Norton produced their second full album, Doolittle, which was recorded in the last six weeks of 1988 and seen as a departure from the raw sound of Come On Pilgrim and Surfer Rosa. Doolittle had a much cleaner sound, largely due to Norton and the production budget of US$40,000, which was quadruple that of Surfer Rosa.Doolittle featured the single ""Here Comes Your Man"", which biographers Josh Frank and Caryn Ganz describe as an unusually jaunty and pop-like song for the band. ""Monkey Gone to Heaven"" was a Top 10 modern rock radio hit in the U.S., and reached the Top 100 in the U.K. Like Surfer Rosa, Doolittle was acclaimed by fans and music critics alike. 

Hiatus (1989-90):
After Doolittle tensions between Deal and Francis came to a head (for example, Francis threw a guitar at Deal during a concert in Stuttgart), and Deal was almost fired from the band when she refused to play at a concert in Frankfurt. Santiago, in an interview with Mojo, described Deal as being ""headstrong and wanting to include her own songs, to explore her own world"" on the band's albums; eventually she accepted that Francis was the singer and had musical control of the band, but after the Frankfurt incident, ""they kinda stopped talking"". The band became increasingly tired during the post-Doolittle ""Fuck or Fight"" tour of the United States and fighting among members continued. After the tour's final date in New York, the band was too exhausted to attend the end-of-tour party the following night and soon announced a hiatus. 
During this time, Santiago and Lovering went on vacation, while Francis performed a short solo tour, made up of a number of concerts to generate gas money as he traveled across the country. Deal formed a new band, The Breeders, with Tanya Donelly of Throwing Muses and bass player Josephine Wiggs of Perfect Disaster. Their debut album, Pod, was released in 1990. 

Bossanova, Trompe le Monde, and break-up (1990-2002):

In 1990, all members of the group except for Deal moved to Los Angeles. Lovering stated that he, Santiago, and Francis moved there ""because the recording studio was there"". Unlike previous recordings, the band had little time to practice beforehand, and Black Francis wrote much of the album in the studio. Featuring the singles ""Velouria"" and ""Dig for Fire"", Bossanova reached number 70 in the United States. In contrast, the album peaked at number three in the United Kingdom. Also in 1990, the Pixies released a cover of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band's ""Born in Chicago"" on the compilation album Rubáiyát: Elektra's 40th Anniversary. 
The band continued to tour and released Trompe le Monde in 1991, their final album before their break-up. The album included ""U-Mass"", which has been described as being about college apathy, and whose guitar riff was written years before at the University of Massachusetts before Francis and Santiago dropped out. The album also featured a cover of ""Head On"" by The Jesus and Mary Chain. Also that year, the band contributed a cover of ""I Can't Forget"" to the Leonard Cohen tribute album I'm Your Fan, and began an international tour on which they played stadiums in Europe and smaller venues in the United States. They then embarked on an uncomfortable tour supporting U2 on their Zoo TV Tour in 1992. Tensions rose between band members, and, at the end of the year, the Pixies went on sabbatical and focused on separate projects. 
In early 1993, Francis announced in an interview to BBC Radio 5 that the band was finished and offered no explanation at the time, unbeknownst to the other members of the band. He later called Santiago and subsequently notified Deal and Lovering via fax, in January 1993. After the break-up, the four members embarked on separate projects. Black Francis renamed himself Frank Black, and he released several solo albums, including a string of releases with Frank Black and the Catholics. Deal returned to The Breeders, who scored a hit with ""Cannonball"" from that group's platinum-selling Last Splash in 1993, and released two more albums several years later. She also formed and released one album with The Amps. Santiago played lead guitar on multiple Frank Black albums, as well as on other artists' albums. He wrote theme music for the show Undeclared on Fox television and for Crime and Punishment in Suburbia. He formed a band called The Martinis with his wife, Linda Mallari, who released an album in 2004. In 2004, he also played lead guitar on the album ""Statecraft"" by the novelist and musician Charles Douglas. Lovering went on to become a magician and made occasional appearances as ""The Scientific Phenomenalist"", performing experiments on stage and occasionally opening for Frank Black and The Breeders. Lovering continued to do some drumming, playing with the band Cracker, as well as on one of Tanya Donelly's solo albums, and on the Martinis' song ""Free"", which appeared on the Empire Records soundtrack. 
4AD and Elektra Records continued to release Pixies material in the band's absence. They released the best-of album Death to the Pixies (1997), the Peel-session compilation Pixies at the BBC (1998), and the Complete 'B' Sides compilation (2001). Meanwhile, in 2002 material from the band's original 17-track demo tape was released as an EP, Pixies, on Cooking Vinyl in the U.K. and SpinArt Records in the U.S.; Frank Black has also used these labels to release solo work and albums with The Catholics. 

Reunion (2003-12):
In the 11 years following the break-up, rumors sometimes circulated regarding a reunion. Though Frank Black steadfastly dismissed them, he did begin to incorporate an increasing number of Pixies songs in his sets with The Catholics, and occasionally included Santiago in his solo work and Lovering's magic show as an opening act to concerts. 
In 2003, a series of phone calls between band members resulted in some low-key rehearsals, and soon to a decision to reunite. By February 2004, a full tour was announced, and tickets for nearly all the initial tour dates sold out within minutes. The band's four-night run at London's Brixton Academy was the fastest selling in the venue's twenty-year history. 
The Pixies played their first reunion concert on April 13, 2004, at The Fine Line Music Cafe in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and a warm-up tour through the U.S. and Canada was followed by an appearance at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. The band then spent much of 2004 touring throughout Brazil, Europe, Japan, and the U.S. The group won the Act-of-the-Year award in the 2004 Boston Music Awards. The 2004 reunion tour reportedly grossed over $14 million in ticket sales. 
In June 2004, the band released a new song, ""Bam Thwok"" exclusively on the iTunes Music Store. The song reached number one in the UK Official Download Chart. 4AD released Wave of Mutilation: The Best of Pixies, along with a companion DVD, entitled Pixies. The band also contributed a rendition of ""Ain't That Pretty At All"" to the Warren Zevon tribute album Enjoy Every Sandwich. ""Bam Thwok"" and ""Ain't That Pretty At All"" were both recorded by engineer Ben Mumphrey, the former at Stagg Street Studios in Van Nuys, CA and the latter at Metamorphosis Studio in Vienna, Austria. 
In 2005, the band made appearances at festivals including Lollapalooza, ""T on the Fringe"", and the Newport Folk Festival. They continued to make appearances through 2006 and 2007, culminating in their first-ever appearances in Australia. Since 2005, Francis has at various times stated that the Pixies recording a new studio album was either a possibility, or an unlikelihood, the main obstacle being Deal's reluctance to do so. 
To celebrate the 20th anniversary of the release of Doolittle, the Pixies launched a tour in October 2009 where they performed the album track-for-track, including the associated B-sides. The tour began in Europe, continued in the United States in November, with the Southamerican and Australian tour following in March 2010, then New Zealand, and more European dates in spring 2010, and back to North America in fall 2010 and into spring 2011. In the autumn of 2011 the ""Imaginary Cities"" tour continued the ""Doolittle Tour"" as they played many venues for the first time. 

Kim Deal's departure, ""Bagboy"" and new material (2013-present):
On June 14, 2013, it was announced by the band's Twitter profile that Kim Deal had left the band. Deal has since posted new solo music on her website and the remaining Pixies have welcomed her to come back as her schedule with Breeders allows. Two weeks later, the band released a new song, ""Bagboy"", as a free download via the Pixies website. The song features Jeremy Dubs of Bunnies and formerly of the Bennies on vocals in place of Deal. 
On July 1, 2013, the Pixies announced the addition of The Muffs and The Pandoras guitarist and vocalist Kim Shattuck, who would be replacing Deal for the band's 2013 European tour. On September 3, 2013 Pixies released an EP of new songs titled EP1. On November 29, 2013, Shattuck announced that she had been dismissed from the band that day. In December 2013, Paz Lenchantin was announced as the new bassist for the 2014 tour. More new material surfaced when Pixies released their second EP, titled EP2, on January 3, 2014. The single released to radio was ""Blue Eyed Hexe."" Another new EP, called EP3, was released on March 24, 2014. All the EPs were only available as downloads and limited edition vinyl. The three EPs were collected in LP format and released as the album Indie Cindy in April 2014. The album was the first release from the band in over two decades, the last being Trompe le Monde in 1991. 
In 2015 it was revealed that the Pixies would go on tour with former Led Zeppelin frontman Robert Plant for a series of dates across North America.]",0.318409679147,0.807321,"[alternative rock, permanent wave, boston rock, lo-fi, indie rock, noise pop]",0.688248,0.0450960849427,0.66418000844,0.25837376124,0.787534549768,0.0416076373724,2.0,0.117132261499,0.536076906459,1.0,0.0294117664286,0.791655539872,4.0,0.866205312356,1

History:

Formation and early days:
Wavves started in 2008 as the recording project of Nathan Williams. Wavves released several 7""s as well as a cassette leading up to the first two releases, Wavves (Woodsist) and Wavvves (Fat Possum/Bella Union). After gaining recognition, Ryan Ulsh was enlisted as a touring drummer and Wavves embarked on their first US and European tours. Wavves released their self-titled debut album in 2008, subsequently drawing the attention of Pitchfork Media. At the time, the band consisted of guitarist Nathan Williams and drummer Ryan Ulsh. 

Wavvves (2009-2010):

Singer Nathan Williams experienced a public breakdown as the band was unable to complete their set at the 2009 Barcelona Primavera Sound Festival. Williams, who admitted he had taken a cocktail of ecstasy and Valium, fought with drummer Ryan Ulsh and insulted the Spanish crowd, who then pelted him with bottles and a green shoe. Apologizing for their performance, Williams admitted the next day that he was addicted to alcohol. As a result, the band canceled the remainder of their European tour. When Ulsh quit the band, Zach Hill replaced him as the drummer for Wavves for a brief time. Two members formerly of the late Jay Reatard's band, drummer Billy Hayes and bassist Stephen Pope, joined Wavves in November 2009. Williams also reported that an album featuring Zach Hill on drums was to be expected towards the end of 2010 along with a possible EP featuring Hayes and Pope.

History:

Early years:
Each of the members of The Walkmen grew up in and around the Washington, DC area, played in many of the same bands from early in their careers, and even attended the same Washington-area high school, St. Albans School (Washington, D.C.). The bandmates eventually moved to Harlem. 
The band was formed in 2000 following the breakup of two separate bands: Jonathan Fire*Eater, whose members included Martin, Maroon and Barrick, and The Recoys, whose members included Leithauser and Bauer. The three members from Jonathan Fire*Eater, which had recorded for Dreamworks Records, had money left over from that past recording contract and used the remaining funds to construct a rehearsal space in uptown New York. The rehearsal space featured a 24-track recording studio and was dubbed Marcata Studios. 
The newly formed band, who wished to distance themselves from the garage rock sounds of previous bands, released a self-titled EP of songs in 2001 on Startime International, a small Brooklyn-based record label. Shortly after the release of the EP, which featured a blend of upright pianos and other vintage instruments, The Walkmen made their official live debut with a performance at Joe's Pub in the East Village. 

Everyone Who Pretended to Like Me Is Gone:
The 2002 debut album Everyone Who Pretended to Like Me Is Gone, released by Startime, was well received by critics. The album was noted for its innovative approach to atmosphere and instrumentation, with sparse bass and drums complemented by plinking piano, jangly guitars and Leithauser's unique vocal stylings. Two of the songs on the album, ""The Blizzard of '96"" and ""That's the Punchline,"" were adaptations of tracks meant for The Recoys' unreleased full-length album. 
Critics compared the results of the album to past work by U2 and The Cure as a result of the uniqueness of its sound as compared to other contemporary New York City bands such as The Strokes. One of the album's songs, ""We've Been Had,"" was featured in a commercial for a Saturn Ion automobile. 

Bows + Arrows:
The band's follow-up album, Bows + Arrows, was released on the Record Collection label in 2004 and was listed by many critics as one of the year's best albums. The album spawned singles for the songs ""The Rat"" and ""Little House of Savages."" Critical success of the album led the band to perform on the popular Fox series The O.C.Bows + Arrows was noted for containing a more immediate and focused sound than its predecessor; both ""The Rat"" and ""Little House of Savages"" were seen as stark contrasts to much of the band's past outputs. 

A Hundred Miles Off and Pussy Cats:
Their next album, A Hundred Miles Off, was released in the U.S. on May 23, 2006. The band premiered most of the new songs on a tour of the Northeast in early 2006. The first single to be released was ""Louisiana,"" which featured an upbeat chorus of horns. Peter Bauer and Walter Martin traded musical instruments on the new album, with Bauer handling the organ duties and Martin playing bass. The album found the band refocusing its sound toward folk sounds, unlike their previous two albums; though the change in direction was lauded by some critics, other reviews were often mixed. 
The band was forced to close Marcata Studios that same year after Columbia University purchased the building it resided in. The band released another full-length album, ""Pussy Cats"" Starring the Walkmen, a track-by-track cover of Harry Nilsson and John Lennon's 1974 album Pussy Cats, as a farewell to their studio's Harlem location. 

You & Me:
Their next studio album, You & Me, became available on July 29, 2008, as an exclusive charitable pre-release on indie music website Amie Street. The Walkmen made the album available for $5 on Amie Street, with all proceeds donated to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. During its first week of sales, the album charted at No. 29 on Billboard's Top Digital Albums. The album was made available on physical formats on August 19, 2008. The album was recorded at Gigantic Studios with Chris Zane. 

Lisbon:
The Walkmen recorded 13 songs for their latest album in five days in August 2009 with John Congleton and Chris Zane. They had been playing several of the songs since the summer of 2009. They recorded ""something like 28 songs,"" but included only 11 on the album. In support of the new album, The Walkmen performed at All Tomorrow Parties in May 2010, Lollapalooza in early August 2010, and the Reading and Leeds Festivals at the end of August 2010. Lisbon was released on September 14, 2010 on label Fat Possum records. Initial reviews have been favorable, with Pitchfork Media awarding the album 8.6/10, and PopMatters rating it 7/10. The band embarked on a fall tour of North America and Europe to support their new release. 

Heaven:
Pitchfork announced that Heaven would be out on June 4 (Europe/UK) and on June 5 (US). It was completed in early March, as mentioned by the band on their website on March 7, 2012. ""Hi everyone. Our album is finally done and we're thrilled with it. We can't wait to get it out there."" 
They released the song entitled ""Heaven"" to the public through Pitchfork Media's website on April 16, 2012, sparking the website to give the title ""Best New Track"" on the same day. 
The Walkmen toured in early 2012 for their 10th anniversary of Everyone Who Pretended to Like Me Is Gone, and during that tour they played many new songs. 
They released their album, Heaven, on May 29, 2012. Pitchfork rated it 8.1, and Stereogum called it the second best album of the year. American Songwriter says of The Walkmen that Heaven is ""arguably their best, and certainly most accomplished album yet."" Still in Rock gave the album a 7.8 rating and made a selection of the best tracks on the album. 
The music video for the album's tenth track, ""The Love You Love"", was shot at the infamous Baleroy Mansion in Philadelphia by the band who was looking for a haunted site. 
The song ""Heaven"" was also used as the closing song on the series finale of the hit CBS show How I Met Your Mother.]",0.384639727295,0.658301,"[indie rock, noise pop, lo-fi, garage rock, neo-psychedelic, dance-punk, indie pop, chamber pop, nu gaze, alternative rock, noise rock, freak folk, slow core, folk christmas, indie folk]",0.594864,0.0214861566365,0.505038530747,0.242830111994,0.408997301934,0.77862903821,7.0,0.116427732414,0.804061352344,0.0,0.0346884159481,0.758128918221,4.0,0.205193108917,1

Its best-known lineup consisted of vocalist/guitarist Lou Reed, bassist/violist John Cale, guitarist Sterling Morrison and drummer Maureen Tucker. The band also collaborated with Nico for their debut album in 1967, under the supervision of producer and pop artist Andy Warhol.  Some see The Velvet Underground as being a bridge between the pacifist themes of the late 60s and the sheer chaos and indifference of the mid-70s punk movement.  The Velvet Underground was one of the first rock music groups to experiment heavily with the form by incorporating avant-garde influences. The group's often raw, sometimes difficult sound would influence many later punk, noise rock, and alternative music performers, and singer Lou Reed's lyrics brought new levels of social realism and sleaze to rock. Critics Scott Isler and Ira Robbins argue that ""The Velvet Underground marked a turning point in rock history. After the release of The Velvet Underground & Nico knowing the power of which it was capable, the music could never be as innocent, as unselfconscious as before.""  Pre-history (1964-1965)  The foundations for what would become The Velvet Underground were laid in late 1964. Lou Reed had performed with a few short-lived garage bands and had worked as a songwriter for Pickwick Records, a job Reed described as ""a poor man's Carole King"". Reed met John Cale, a Welshman who had moved to the United States to study classical music. Cale had worked with John Cage and La Monte Young, but was also interested in rock music. (Young's use of extended drones would be a profound influence on the early Velvet's sound). The pair rehearsed and performed together, and their partnership and shared interests steered the early direction of what would become the Velvet Underground.  Reed's first group with Cale was the short-lived The Primitives, assembled to support a Reed-penned single, ""The Ostrich"". Reed and Cale recruited Sterling Morrison - a college classmate of Reed's who had already played with him a few times - to play guitar, and Angus MacLise to play percussion. This quartet was first called The Warlocks, then The Falling Spikes.  While moving into his New York City apartment Reed found the book The Velvet Underground by Michael Leigh, a book about sadomasochism, left by previous tenant Tony Conrad. Reed and Morrison have reported the group liked the name, considering it evocative of ""underground cinema,"" and fitting, due to Reed's already having written ""Venus in Furs"", inspired by Leopold von Sacher-Masoch's book of the same name, also dealing with sadomasochism. The band immediately and unanimously adopted the book's title for its new name.  Early stages (1965-1966)  The newly named Velvet Underground rehearsed and performed in New York City. Their music was generally much more relaxed than it would later become: Cale described this era as reminiscent of beatnik poetry, with MacLise playing gentle ""pitter and patter rhythms behind the drone"".  In July of 1965, Reed, Cale and Morrison recorded a demo tape. When he briefly returned to Britain, Cale gave a copy of the tape to Marianne Faithfull, hoping she'd pass it on to Mick Jagger. Nothing ever came of the demo. The demo was eventually released on the 1995 box set Peel Slowly And See.  When the group accepted an offer of $75 for their first paying performance at Summit High School, in Summit, NJ, MacLise left the group, protesting what he considered a sell out. ""Angus was in it for art"", Morrison reported.  MacLise was replaced by Maureen Tucker, Jim Tucker's younger sister. Tucker's abbreviated drum kit was rather unusual: She generally played on tom toms and an upturned bass drum, using mallets rather than drumsticks, and she rarely used cymbals. The band having asked her to 'do something unusual', she turned her bass drum on its side, and played standing up. When her drums were stolen from one club, she replaced them with garbage cans, brought in from outside. Her driving rhythms were at once simple yet exotic, influenced by Babatunde Olatunji and Bo Diddley records, and became an essential part of the group's music. The group earned a regular paying gig at a club, and gained an early reputation as a promising ensemble.  While the American west coast was undergoing the Summer of Love, psychedelia and flower power, the typically east coast Velvets concerned themselves with darker subject matter: transvestites, heroin addiction, and sadomasochism. Also setting them apart from their contemporaries was their use of feedback and amplifier noise in a musical context, exemplified by the seventeen minute track ""Sister Ray"" from their White Light/White Heat album.  Andy Warhol and the Exploding. Plastic. Inevitable (1966-1967)  Andy Warhol became the band's manager in 1965, and suggested they feature the german-born singer Nico on several songs. Warhol's reputation certainly helped the band gain a higher profile. Though Reed eventually fired Warhol, he praised the integrity of his early efforts with the group. Warhol helped the band land a coveted recording contract with MGM's Verve Records, with himself as nominal 'producer', and gave the Velvets unprecedented free reign over the sound they created.  During their stay with Andy Warhol, the band became part of his multimedia roadshow Exploding. Plastic. Inevitable., for which they provided the musical part. This show played a couple of months in New York City, then took to the road all over the United States and Canada until its last installment in May 1967.  In 1966, MacLise temporarily rejoined the Velvet Underground for a few E.P.I. shows when Reed was suffering from hepatitis and unable to perform. For these appearances, Cale sang and played organ and Tucker switched to bass guitar. Also at these appearances, the band often played an extended jam they had dubbed ""The Booker T"", after the leader of the musical group Booker T & The MG's; the jam later became the music for ""The Gift"" on White Light/White Heat. Some of these performances have been released as a bootleg; they remain the only recordings of MacLise with the Velvet Underground.  The Velvet Underground and Nico (1967)  At Warhol's insistence, Nico sang with the Velvet Underground on four songs off their debut album, The Velvet Underground & Nico. The album was recorded in one or two days -- there is some uncertainty between the band members' memories -- at TT&G Studios during the November of 1966, and released by MGM Records in March of 1967.  The album cover was famous for its simple, suggestive Warhol design: a bright yellow banana with ""Peel Slowly and See"" printed near a perforated tab. Those who did remove the banana skin found a pink, phallic, peeled banana beneath. This would later be used as the cover to their boxed set, appropriately titled ""Peel Slowly And See,"" released in 1995.  Eleven songs showcased their stylistic range, veering from the pounding attacks of ""I'm Waiting for the Man"" and ""Run Run Run,"" the droning ""Venus in Furs"" and ""Heroin"" to the quiet ""Femme Fatale"" and the tender ""I'll Be Your Mirror"".  The overall sound was propelled by Reed's strong deadpan vocals, Cale's droning or shrieking viola, Morrison's often rhythm and blues or country-influenced guitar, and Tucker's hypnotically simple but steady, propulsive beat.  The Velvet Underground & Nico peaked at number 171 on Billboard Magazine's top 200 charts, but the promising debut was dampened somewhat by legal complications: The album's back cover featured a still from a Warhol motion picture, Chelsea Girls. The film's cinematographer, Eric Emerson, had been arrested for drug possession and, desperate for money, claimed the still had been included on the album without his permission. MGM Records pulled all copies of the album until the legal problems were settled (by which time the record had lost its modest commercial momentum), and the still was airbrushed out.  White Light/White Heat (1968)  The Velvet Underground performed live often, and their performances became louder, harsher and often featured extended improvisations. Cale reports that at about this time, The Velvet Underground were one of the first groups to receive an endorsement from Vox. The company pioneered a number of special effects, which the Velvet Underground utilized on White Light/White Heat.  Reed fired Warhol as manager, and Nico was jettisoned, partly due to her unreliability. In September 1967, the VU recorded what would become their second album, White Light/White Heat, with Tom Wilson as producer. It was released January 1968.  The recording was raw and oversaturated, one of the harshest, loudest records yet released. Cale has stated that while the debut had some moments of fragility and beauty, White Light/White Heat was ""consciously anti-beauty"". Isler and Robbins suggest that the record ""is almost unbearably intense.""  The title track and first song starts things off with Reed pounding on piano like a demented Jerry Lee Lewis. The eerie, hallucinatory ""Lady Godiva's Operation"" remains Reed's favorite track on the album.  Despite the dominance of noisefests like ""Sister Ray"", and ""I Heard Her Call My Name"", there was room for the darkly comic ""The Gift"", a Reed-penned short story narrated in Cale's deadpan Welsh accent. The meditative ""Here She Comes Now"" was later covered by Galaxie 500, Cabaret Voltaire, and Nirvana.  In 1968, a year after Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Are You Experienced, there was an experimental feeling throughout rock music, while it should be noted that the Velvets are arguably the foremost pioneers in this realm. There were a few other experimenters with noise, but few were tackling noise with as much apparent glee as the V.U. White Light/White Heat was hugely important, and ""Sister Ray"" is arguably one of the most significant rock songs of the late 1960s. The songs' simple 3-chord progression along with screeching organ and lead guitar, all distorted perhaps beyond the bounds of tastefulness, coupled with William Burroughs-influenced lyrics, was completely unique. ""Sister Ray"" is often seen as one of the earliest precursors of punk and alternative rock, with its blistering instrumentation and alarming lyrics.  The second album's cover was a subtle black-on-black picture of the tattooed arm of Billy Name, one of Warhol's ""Factory"" members. White Light/White Heat entered the Billboard top 200 chart for 2 weeks, at number 199.  Tensions were growing: the group was tired of receiving little recognition for their hard work, and Reed and Cale were pulling the Velvet Underground in different directions. The differences showed in the last recording session the band had with John Cale in February 1968: two pop-like songs in Reed's direction (""Temptation Inside Your Heart"" and ""Stephanie Says""), and a viola-driven drone in Cale's direction (""Hey mr Rain""). None of these songs were released until they were included on the VU and Another View compilation albums.  The Velvet Underground (1969)  Before work on their third album started, Reed fired Cale, and replaced him with Doug Yule. The Velvet Underground was recorded in late 1968, and released in March of 1969.  It's often been reported that the early edition of the Velvet Underground was a struggle between Reed and Cale's creative impulses: Reed's rather conventional approach contrasted with Cale's experimentalist tendencies. The Velvet Underground would seem to prove the truth of these claims, as the harsh, abrasive tendencies on the first two records were almost entirely absent. This resulted in a gentler sound influenced by folk music, prescient of the songwriting style that would form Reed's solo career (another factor in the change of sound was the band's amplifiers being stolen from an airport while they were on tour; they obtained replacements by signing a new endorsement deal with Sunn).  Morrison's ringing guitar parts and Yule's melodic bass guitar and harmony vocals are featured prominently on the album. Reed's songs and singing are subdued and confessional, and he shared lead vocals with Yule, particularly when his own voice would fail under stress. A rare Maureen Tucker vocal is featured on ""After Hours,"" a song that Reed said was so innocent and pure he couldn't possibly sing it himself. The album's influence can be heard in many later indie rock and lo-fi recordings.  A year on the road and the ""lost"" fourth album (1969)  The Velvet Underground spent much of 1969 on the road, feeling they were not accepted in their hometown of New York City and not making much headway commercially. During the same year, the band recorded on and off in the studio, creating a lot of material that was never officially released due to disputes with their record label. What many consider the prime of these sessions was released many years later as VU. This album has a transitional sound between the whisper-soft third album and the pop-rock anthems of their final record, Loaded.  The rest of the recordings, as well as some alternate takes, were bundled on Another View. After Reed's departure, he later reworked a number of these songs for his solo records (""Stephanie Says"", ""Ocean"", ""I Can't Stand It"", ""Lisa Says"", ""She's My Best Friend""). Indeed, most of Reed's early solo career's more successful hits were reworked Velvet Underground tracks, released for the first time in their original version on VU, Another View, and later on Peel Slowly And See. The standout from VU is considered by many to be ""One Of These Days,"" part torch song and part slide-guitar freakout.  Loaded (1970)  In 1969, MGM Records president Mike Curb wanted to purge any drug- or hippie-related bands from MGM, and the V.U. were on his list, along with Frank Zappa's Mothers of Invention. (Nonetheless, MGM insisted on keeping the tapes of their unissued recordings.)  Atlantic Records signed the Velvet Underground for what would be its final studio album, Loaded, released on Atlantic's subsidiary label Cotillion. The album's title refers to Atlantic's request that the band produce an album ""loaded with hits."" Though the record was not the smash hit the company had anticipated, it contains the most accessible pop the V.U. had performed, and several of Reed's best-known songs, including ""Sweet Jane"" and ""Rock And Roll"".  Though Tucker had temporarily retired from the group due to her pregnancy, she received a performance credit on Loaded. Drums were actually played by several people, including Yule, engineer Adrian Barber, session musician Tommy Castanaro, and Doug Yule's brother Billy, who was still in high school.  Disillusioned with the lack of progress the band was making and pressured by manager Sesnick, Reed decided to quit the band and did so in August 1970. The band essentially broke while recording the album, and Reed walked off before it was finished. Doug Yule finished the album, singing parts to some of Reed's vocal tracks. Lou Reed has often said he was completely surprised months later when he saw Loaded in stores. He also said, bitterly, ""I left them to their album full of hits that I made.""  Reed was particularly bitter about the truncation of a verse from ""Sweet Jane"". ""New Age"" was changed as well: as originally recorded, its closing line (""It's the beginning of a new age"") was repeated many more times. A brief interlude in ""Rock And Roll"" was also removed. (Years later, the album would be reissued with the edits restored.) On the other hand, Yule has pointed that the album was to all intents and purposes finished when Reed left the band and that Reed had been aware of most if not all of the edits. The few weeks between Reed's departure in late August and Loaded's arrival in the shops in September of the same year also would have left little room for the whole process of editing, reviewing, mastering and pressing.  1970 onwards  Although Loaded's spin-off single ""Who Loves The Sun"" did nothing, the album itself is something of a muted triumph. ""Sweet Jane"" and ""Rock And Roll"" became U.S. radio favorites, and the band, featuring Walter Powers III on bass, and Doug Yule promoted to lead vocals and guitar, went on the road once more, playing the East Coast of the U.S. and Europe. By that time, however, Sterling Morrison had obtained a B.A. degree in English, and left the group for an academic career with the University of Texas at Austin. His replacement was singer/keyboard player Willie Alexander. The band played shows in England, Wales, and the Netherlands, some of which are collected on the 2001 box set Final V.U. (Longtime fans began mocking the new lineup as the ""Velveteen Underground"", perhaps unfairly.)  In 1972 Atlantic released Live at Max's Kansas City, a live bootleg of one of the Velvet Underground's final performances with Reed, recorded by fan Brigid Polk. By this time Doug Yule was once again touring the United Kingdom, this time backed with hired hands as Sesnick had sent home Tucker, Powers and Alexander, effectively ending their time with the band. Later that year, Sesnick managed to secure a recording contract with Polydor Records in England, and Yule recorded Squeeze under the Velvet Underground name with Deep Purple drummer Ian Paice. Squeeze is a controversial item among Velvet fans, most of whom flatly decline to consider any post-Lou Reed material as worthwhile. Rarely heard before the advent of Internet audio file sharing, the album's perceived Middle of the road content is sometimes dismissed out of hand by Velvets fans. Although the album technically is a Velvet Underground release, it is properly Doug Yule's debut solo album and it might have fared far better if it had been labeled as such, given the actual quality of most of the tracks, some of which would not have been out of place on Loaded. (Interestingly, Yule was actually in the group longer than Cale.)  Post-VU developments (1973-1990)  Reed and Cale, in the meantime, developed solo careers. Sterling Morrison was a professor for some time, teaching Medieval Literature at the University of Texas at Austin, then became a tugboat captain for several years. Maureen Tucker raised a family before returning to small-scale gigging and recording in the 1980s; Morrison was in a number of touring bands, among others with Tucker's band. In 1988, erstwhile singer Nico died of a brain hemorrhage while bicycling on the island of Ibiza.  Reunions (1990 and 1992-1994)  In 1990, Reed and Cale released Songs For Drella, dedicated to the recently deceased Andy Warhol. (""Drella"" was a nickname Warhol had adopted, a combination of ""Dracula"" and ""Cinderella"".) Though Morrison and Tucker had each worked with Reed and Cale since the V.U. broke up, Songs For Drella was the first time the mercurial pair had worked together in decades, and rumors of a reunion began to circulate, fueled by the one-off appearance by Lou Reed, John Cale, Sterling Morrison and Maureen Tucker to play ""Heroin"" as the encore to a brief Songs For Drella set in Jouy-en-Josas, France.  The same lineup briefly reunited from 1992-1994, resulting in a European tour -- both headlining and opening a few concerts for U2 -- and a live album, Live MCMXCIII. Cale sang most of the songs Nico had performed with the group.  Before the band could tour the U.S. or record -- an MTV Unplugged album was proposed -- Cale and Reed fell out again, breaking up the band once more.

Originally managed by Andy Warhol, the group served as the house band at the Factory and Warhol's Exploding Plastic Inevitable events from 1966 to 1967. The provocative subject matter and often nihilistic attitudes explored in their music would prove massively influential in the development of punk rock and alternative music. 
Their 1967 debut album, The Velvet Underground & Nico (which featured German singer and collaborator Nico), was called the ""most prophetic rock album ever made"" by Rolling Stone in 2003. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked the band No. 19 on its list of the ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"". The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 by Patti Smith. 

History:

Pre-career (1964-1965):
The foundations for what would become the Velvet Underground were laid in late 1964. Singer/songwriter/guitarist Lou Reed had performed with a few short-lived garage bands and had worked as a songwriter for Pickwick Records (Reed described his tenure there as being ""a poor man's Carole King""). Reed met John Cale, a Welshman who had moved to the United States to study classical music upon securing a scholarship. Cale had worked with experimental composers Cornelius Cardew and La Monte Young but was also interested in rock music. Young's use of extended drones would be a profound influence on the band's early sound. Cale was pleasantly surprised to discover that Reed's experimentalist tendencies were similar to his own: Reed sometimes used alternative guitar tunings to create a droning sound. The pair rehearsed and performed together; their partnership and shared interests built the path towards what would later become the Velvet Underground. 
Reed's first group with Cale was the Primitives, a short-lived group assembled to issue budget-priced recordings and support an anti-dance single penned by Reed, ""The Ostrich"", to which Cale added a viola passage. Reed and Cale recruited Sterling Morrison--a college classmate of Reed's at Syracuse University--as a replacement for Walter De Maria, who had been a third member of the Primitives. Reed and Morrison both played guitars, Cale played viola, keyboards and bass and Angus MacLise joined on percussion to complete the initial four-member unit. This quartet was first called The Warlocks, then The Falling Spikes. 
The Velvet Underground by Michael Leigh was a contemporary mass market paperback about the secret sexual subculture of the early 1960s that Cale's friend Tony Conrad showed the group. MacLise made a suggestion to adopt the title as the band's name. According to Reed and Morrison, the group liked the name, considering it evocative of ""underground cinema"", and fitting, as Reed had already written ""Venus in Furs"", a song inspired by Leopold von Sacher-Masoch's book of the same name, which dealt with masochism. The band immediately and unanimously adopted the Velvet Underground as its new name in November 1965. 

Early stages (1965-1966):
The newly named Velvet Underground rehearsed and performed in New York City. Their music was generally much more relaxed than it would later become: Cale described this era as reminiscent of beat poetry, with MacLise playing gentle ""pitter and patter rhythms behind the drone"". 
In July 1965, Reed, Cale and Morrison recorded a demo tape at their Ludlow Street loft, but without MacLise because he wasn't reliable enough to be tied down to a schedule and sometimes would only turn up to band practice sessions when he wanted to. When he briefly returned to Britain, Cale attempted to give a copy of the tape to Marianne Faithfull, hoping she'd pass it on to Mick Jagger, lead singer of The Rolling Stones. Nothing ever came of this, but the demo was eventually released on the 1995 box set Peel Slowly and See. 
Manager and music journalist Al Aronowitz arranged for the group's first paying gig--$75 to play at Summit High School, in Summit, New Jersey, opening for The Myddle Class. When the group decided to take the gig, MacLise left the group, protesting what he considered a sellout. ""Angus was in it for art"", Morrison reported. 
MacLise was replaced by Maureen ""Moe"" Tucker, the younger sister of Morrison's friend Jim Tucker. Tucker's playing style was rather unusual: she generally played standing up rather than seated and had an abbreviated drum setup of tom toms, snare and an upturned bass drum, using mallets as often as drumsticks, and rarely using cymbals (she admits that she always hated cymbals). (The band having asked her to do something unusual, she turned her bass drum on its side and played standing up. When her drums were stolen from one club, she replaced them with garbage cans, brought in from outside.) Her rhythms, at once simple and exotic (influenced by the likes of Babatunde Olatunji and Bo Diddley records), became a vital part of the group's music, despite Cale's initial objections to the presence of a female drummer. The group earned a regular paying gig at the Café Bizarre and gained an early reputation as a promising ensemble. 

Andy Warhol and the Exploding Plastic Inevitable (1966-1967):
In 1965, after being introduced to the Velvet Underground by filmmaker Barbara Rubin, Andy Warhol became the band's manager and suggested they feature the German-born singer Nico (born Christa Päffgen) on several songs. Warhol's reputation helped the band gain a higher profile. He helped the band secure a coveted recording contract with MGM's Verve Records, with himself as nominal ""producer"", and gave the Velvets free rein over the sound they created. 
During their stay with Andy Warhol, the band became part of his multimedia roadshow, Exploding Plastic Inevitable, for which they provided the music. They played shows for several months in New York City, then traveled throughout the United States and Canada until its last installment in May 1967. The show included 16 mm film projections and colors by Warhol. Early promo posters referred to the group as the ""erupting plastic inevitable"". This soon changed to ""the exploding plastic inevitable"". 
In 1966, MacLise temporarily rejoined the Velvet Underground for a few EPI shows when Reed was suffering from hepatitis and unable to perform. For these appearances, Cale sang and played organ and Tucker switched to bass guitar. Also at these appearances, the band often played an extended jam they had dubbed ""Booker T"", after musician Booker T. Jones'. Some of these performances have been released as a bootleg; they remain the only record of MacLise with the Velvet Underground. 
According to Morrison, MacLise is said to have regretted leaving The Velvet Underground and wanted to rejoin, but Reed specifically prohibited this and made it clear that this stint was only temporary. It should be noted, however, that MacLise still went by his own clock: for instance, he showed up half an hour late to one show and carried on with half-hour drumming to compensate for his late arrival, long after the set had finished. 
In December 1966, Warhol and David Dalton designed Issue 3 of the multimedia Aspen. Included in this issue of the ""magazine"", which retailed at $4 per copy and was packaged in a hinged box designed to look like Fab laundry detergent, were various leaflets and booklets, one of which was a commentary on rock and roll by Lou Reed, another an EPI promotional newspaper. Also enclosed was a 2-sided flexi disk, side one produced by Peter Walker, a musical associate of Timothy Leary, and side two titled ""Loop"", credited to the Velvet Underground but actually recorded by Cale alone. ""Loop"", a recording solely of pulsating audio feedback culminating in a locked groove, was ""a precursor to Reed's Metal Machine Music"", say Velvets archivists M.C. Kostek and Phil Milstein in the book The Velvet Underground Companion. ""Loop"" also predates much industrial music. 

The Velvet Underground & Nico (1967):
At Warhol's insistence, Nico sang with the band on three songs of their debut album, The Velvet Underground & Nico. The album was recorded primarily in Scepter Studios in New York City during April 1966. (Some songs were re-recorded, along with the new song ""Sunday Morning"", later in the year with Tom Wilson producing). The album was released by Verve Records the following year in March 1967. 
The album cover is famous for its Warhol design: a yellow banana sticker with ""Peel slowly and see"" printed near the tip. Those who did remove the banana skin found a pink, peeled banana beneath. 
Eleven songs showcased their dynamic range, veering from the pounding attacks of ""I'm Waiting for the Man"" and ""Run Run Run"", the droning ""Venus in Furs"" and ""Heroin"", the chiming and celestial ""Sunday Morning"" to the quiet ""Femme Fatale"" and the tender ""I'll Be Your Mirror"", as well as Warhol's own favorite song of the group, ""All Tomorrow's Parties"".Kurt Loder would later describe ""All Tomorrow's Parties"" as a ""mesmerizing gothic-rock masterpiece"". 
The overall sound was propelled by Reed and Nico's deadpan vocals, Cale's droning viola, bass and keyboards, Reed's experimental avant-garde guitar, Morrison's often rhythm and blues- or country-influenced guitar, and Tucker's simple but steady and tribal-sounding beat with sparse use of cymbals. Another distinct feature on many songs was the ""drone strum"", an eighth-note rhythm guitar style used by Reed. Although Cale was the band's usual bassist, if he switched to viola or keyboards, Morrison would normally play bass. Despite his proficiency on the instrument, Morrison hated playing bass. Conversely, some songs had Reed and Morrison playing their usual guitars with Cale on viola or keyboards, but with nobody playing bass. 

Debut album release and legal problems:
The album was released on March 12, 1967 (after a lengthy delay by Verve) and eventually reached No. 171 on Billboard magazine's Top 200 charts. The promising commercial growth of the album was soon dampened by legal complications: the album's back cover featured a photo of the group playing live with another image projected behind them; the projected image was a still of actor Eric Emerson from a Warhol motion picture, Chelsea Girls. Emerson had been arrested for drug possession and, desperate for money, claimed the still had been included on the album without his permission (in the image, his face appears quite big, but upside down). Instead of compensating Emerson for damages, MGM Records canceled all distribution of the album for nearly two months until the legal problems were settled (by which time the record had lost its modest commercial momentum), and the still was airbrushed out of the remaining copies of the album. By the time the record was re-distributed into stores, the album was re-distributed nearly at the same time as Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band in June 1967, by which time the album faced stiff competition in the marketplace which further hindered the release. Regarding MGM/Verve's delay in releasing the album, Warhol's business manager Paul Morrissey once offered the following: ""Verve/MGM didn't know what to do with The Velvet Underground and Nico because it was so peculiar. They didn't release it for almost a year. Tom Wilson at at Verve/MGM only bought the album from me because of Nico. He saw no talent in Lou Reed.""  
In 1982, Brian Eno said that while the album sold only 30,000 copies in its early years, ""everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band."" 

White Light/White Heat (1968):
Nico moved on after the Velvets severed their relationship with Andy Warhol. Reed once commented on their leaving Warhol: ""Warhol asked do you want to just keep playing museums from now on and the art festivals? Or do you want to start moving into other areas?"" I thought it about it, and I fired him. ... I never saw Andy mad, but I did that day. He was really mad, called me a rat. It was the worst thing he could think of."".Steve Sesnick was soon brought in as a replacement manager, much to the chagrin of Cale, who believes that Sesnick tried to push Reed as band leader at the expense of band harmony. Both Cale and Reed called Sesnick a ""snake"" in different interviews after leaving the band In September 1967, the Velvet Underground began recording their second album, White Light/White Heat, with Tom Wilson as producer. 
The Velvet Underground performed live often, and their performances became louder, harsher and often featured extended improvisations. Cale reports that at about this time the Velvet Underground was one of the first groups to receive an endorsement deal from Vox. The company pioneered special effects, which the Velvet Underground utilized on the album. 
Sterling Morrison offered the following input regarding the recording: 

There was fantastic leakage 'cause everyone was playing so loud and we had so much electronic junk with us in the studio--all these fuzzers and compressors. Gary Kellgren, who is ultra-competent, told us repeatedly: ""You can't do it--all the needles are on red."" and we reacted as we always reacted: ""Look, we don't know what goes on in there and we don't want to hear about it. Just do the best you can."" And so the album is fuzzy, there's all that white noise...we wanted to do something electronic and energetic. We had the energy and the electronics, but we didn't know it couldn't be recorded...what we were trying to do was really fry the tracks. 

The recording was raw and oversaturated. Cale has stated that while the debut had some moments of fragility and beauty, White Light/White Heat was ""consciously anti-beauty."" The title track sets a harsh opening, featuring bassist John Cale pounding on the piano in a style akin to Jerry Lee Lewis. It was later included in the repertoire of David Bowie. Despite the dominance of noisefests like ""Sister Ray"" and ""I Heard Her Call My Name"", there was room for the darkly comic ""The Gift"", a short story written by Reed and narrated by Cale in his deadpan Welsh accent. The meditative ""Here She Comes Now"" was later covered by Galaxie 500, Cabaret Voltaire, and Nirvana, among others. 
The album was released on January 30, 1968, entering the Billboard Top 200 chart for two weeks, at a dismal number 199. 

Cale departs:
Tensions were growing: the group was tired of receiving little recognition for its work, and Reed and Cale were pulling the Velvet Underground in different directions. The differences showed in the last recording sessions the band had with John Cale in 1968: three pop-like songs in Reed's direction (""Temptation Inside Your Heart"", ""Stephanie Says"" and ""Beginning to See the Light"") and a viola-driven drone in Cale's direction (""Hey Mr. Rain""). Further, some songs the band had performed with Cale in concert, or that he had co-written, were not recorded until after he had left the group (such as ""Walk It and Talk It"", ""Ride into the Sun"", and ""Countess from Hong Kong""). 
Reed called Morrison and Tucker to a band meeting at the Riviera Cafe on Sheridan Square in the West Village without Cale's knowledge, and delivered an ultimatum by declaring that either Cale was sacked or the Velvets were dissolved. Neither Morrison nor Tucker were happy with the idea, but faced with a choice of either no Cale or no band at all, the pair reluctantly sided with Reed. 
It has often been reported that before Cale's departure (following White Light/White Heat) there was a struggle between his creative impulses and Reed's: Cale's experimentalist tendencies had contrasted with Reed's more conventional approach. According to Tim Mitchell, however, Morrison reported that whilst there was creative tension between Reed and Cale, its impact has been exaggerated over the years. Cale played his last show with the band at the Boston Tea Party in September 1968 and was fired shortly afterwards. 
According to Michael Carlucci, a friend of Robert Quine, ""Lou told Quine that the reason why he had to get rid of Cale in the band was Cale's ideas were just too out there. Cale had some wacky ideas. He wanted to record the next album with the amplifiers underwater, and Lou just couldn't have it. He was trying to make the band more accessible."" Ultimately, Morrison was dispatched by Reed to tell Cale that he was out of the band. 

The Velvet Underground (1969):
Before work on their third album started, Cale was replaced by Doug Yule of Boston group the Grass Menagerie, who had been a close associate of the band. Yule, a native New Yorker, had originally met the Velvets at his apartment in Boston which he happened to be renting from the Velvets' road manager, Hans Onsager, who worked closely with the Velvets manager Steve Sesnick. Sterling Morrison was a frequent house guest at Yule's apartment when the band performed at the Boston Tea Party, and mentioned to Lou Reed that Yule was practicing guitar and was improving quickly. It was following this discussion that led to Yule's invitation to join the Velvets shortly before two upcoming shows in Cleveland, OH at the club La Cave. Yule would handle bass and organ duties in the band, and would contribute vocals as well. After several months of shows in the US, the band recorded their third album The Velvet Underground'. The album was soon recorded in late 1968 at TTG Studios in Hollywood, California, and was released in March 1969. The cover photograph was taken by Billy Name. The LP sleeve was designed by Dick Smith, then a staff artist at MGM/Verve. Released on March 12, 1969, the album failed to make Billboard's Top 200 album chart. 
The harsh, abrasive tendencies on the first two records were almost entirely absent on their third album. This resulted in a gentler sound influenced by folk music, prescient of the songwriting style that would soon form Reed's solo career. While Reed had covered a vast range of lyrical subjects on the first two Velvet Underground albums, the lyrical themes of the third album were more ""intimate"" in nature. Reed's songwriting also covered new emotional ground as well, as heard in the songs ""Pale Blue Eyes"", ""Jesus"", ""Beginning to See the Light"", and ""I'm Set Free"". The personal tone of the album's subject matter resulted in Reed's desire to create a ""closet"" mix that boosted the vocals to the forefront, while reducing the album's instrumentation. The second (and more widely distributed) mix is the stereo mix done by MGM/Verve staff recording engineer Val Valentin. Another factor in the change of sound was the band's Vox amplifiers and assorted fuzzboxes rumored to have been stolen from an airport while they were on tour and they obtained replacements by signing a new endorsement deal with Sunn. In addition, Reed and Morrison had purchased matching Fender 12-string electric guitars, but Doug Yule plays down the influence of the new equipment, however. 
Morrison's ringing guitar parts and Yule's melodic bass guitar and harmony vocals are featured prominently on the album. Reed's songs and singing are subdued and confessional in nature, and he shared lead vocals with Yule, particularly when his own voice would fail under stress. Doug Yule sang the lead vocal on ""Candy Says"" (about the Warhol superstar Candy Darling), which opens the LP, and a rare Maureen Tucker lead vocal is featured on ""After Hours"", which closes the album. It is a song that Reed said was so innocent and pure he could not sing it himself. The album also features the experimental track ""The Murder Mystery"", which featured all four band members (Reed, Yule, Tucker and Morrison) reading different lyrics against each other (to a jarring effect), as well as the ballad ""Pale Blue Eyes"", which would soon be covered by many artists including R.E.M., The Killers, and many more. Despite the album's poor commercial debut upon release in 1969, the album's influence can now be heard in many later indie rock and lo-fi recordings. 

Year on the road, the ""lost"" fourth album, and live recordings (1969):
The Velvet Underground spent much of 1969 on the road both in the US and Canada, feeling they were not accepted in their hometown of New York City and not making much headway commercially. Despite these commercial setbacks, the Velvets focused on performing live shows on the road, playing both re-worked songs from the Velvets' past albums, as well as debuting new songs that would soon find their way onto Loaded, such as ""New Age"", ""Rock and Roll"", and ""Sweet Jane"". While the band still did extended improvisations in their live shows during this period, in '69 the Velvets focused on delivering tight live performances. The live album 1969: The Velvet Underground Live (featuring Reed, Yule, Morrison & Tucker) was recorded in October 1969 but not released until 1974, on Mercury Records at the urging of rock critic Paul Nelson, who worked in A&R for Mercury at the time. Nelson asked singer-songwriter Elliott Murphy to write liner notes for the double album which began, ""I wish it was a hundred years from today..."" 
It was also during this period that the band also played a series of shows in November 1969 in San Francisco, CA, at the venues The Matrix and the Family Dog, and the recordings of these shows were released many years later in 2001 as a triple live album called Bootleg Series Volume 1: The Quine Tapes, - which also featured the line up of Reed, Yule, Morrison and Tucker. During 1969 the band also recorded on and off in the studio, creating a lot of promising material (both singles and one-offs) that were never officially released at the time due to disputes with their record label. What many consider to be the prime songs of these recording sessions were released years later in 1985 in a compilation album VU. The album VU marks the transitional sound between the whisper-soft third album, and the band's movement to the later pop rock song-style of their final record, Loaded. Two of the songs the Velvets recorded during this period would also end up being featured on high profile film soundtracks many years later. The song ""Stephanie Says"" was featured in the 2001 soundtrack to the film The Royal Tenenbaums, and the nursery-rhyme style song ""I'm Sticking With You"", (with its rare Maureen Tucker / Lou Reed duel-lead vocal track, with Doug Yule accompanying on piano) would be re-released many years later in the soundtrack to the 2008 hit film Juno. 
The rest of the recordings, as well as some alternative takes and instrumental tracks were later bundled on Another View which was released in 1986. After Reed's departure, he later reworked a number of these songs for his solo records over the years: (""Stephanie Says"", ""Ocean"", ""I Can't Stand It"", ""Lisa Says"", ""Andy's Chest"", as well as ""She's My Best Friend"", which had been originally sung by Doug Yule). 

Dropped from MGM:
By 1969 the MGM and Verve record labels had been losing money for several years. A new president, Mike Curb, was hired and he decided to cancel the recording contracts of 18 of their acts who supposedly glorified drugs in their lyrics, including their many controversial and unprofitable acts. The drug or hippie-related bands were released from MGM, and the Velvets were on his list, along with Eric Burdon and the Animals and Frank Zappa's Mothers of Invention. Nonetheless MGM insisted on retaining ownership of all master tapes of their recordings and according to an MGM representative in a Rolling Stone article from 1970, ""it wasn't eighteen groups, Curb was misquoted. The cuts were made partly to do with the drug scene--like maybe a third of them had to do with drug reasons. The others were dropped because they weren't selling."" Lou Reed would later remark in the 1987 issue of ""Creem"" that whilst he didn't believe that MGM dropped The Velvets for drug associations, he did acknowledge, ""We wanted to get out of there."" 

Loaded, Tucker's pregnancy and Max's residency (1970):
Atlantic Records signed the Velvet Underground for what would be its final studio album with Lou Reed: Loaded, released on Atlantic's subsidiary label Cotillion. The album's title refers to Atlantic's request that the band produce an album ""loaded with hits"". Though the record was not the smash hit the company had anticipated, it contains the most accessible pop the VU had performed, and two of Reed's best-known songs, including ""Sweet Jane"" and ""Rock and Roll."" 
By the recording of Loaded, Doug Yule played a more prominent role in the band, and with Reed's encouragement, sang the lead vocal on four songs: ""Who Loves the Sun"", which opened the album, ""New Age"", ""Lonesome Cowboy Bill"" and ""Oh! Sweet Nuthin"" which closes the album. Yule once commented on the recording of Loaded: ""Lou leaned on me a lot in terms of musical support and for harmonies, vocal arrangements. I did a lot on Loaded. It sort of devolved down to the Lou and Doug recreational recording."" 
While the third Velvets' LP was recorded mostly live in a collaborative atmosphere, the bulk of Loaded was crafted in the studio. In addition to handling all the bass and piano duties on ""Loaded"", Yule also contributed several lead guitar tracks and doubled on drums as well (notably on the songs ""Rock and Roll"" and ""Sweet Jane"")  since Maureen Tucker was absent on maternity leave to have her first child, a daughter named Kerry. While Sterling Morrison played guitar on ""Loaded"", it was during this time that he resumed his studies at City College of New York, and split his time between classes and the sessions, thus leaving Reed and Yule to handle the bulk of the arrangements. Although Tucker had temporarily retired from the group during the sessions due to her pregnancy, she was incorrectly credited as playing on Loaded, but the drums on the album were actually played by several musicians: Doug Yule, engineer Adrian Barber, session musician Tommy Castanaro, and Billy Yule (Doug Yule's younger brother), who was still in high school at the time. 
It was during the Loaded recording sessions that the Velvets secured a now-legendary nine-week residency (from June 24 - August 28, 1970) at the New York nightclub Max's Kansas City, playing two lengthy sets per night, and showcasing altered arrangements of older songs from their previous albums, as well as showcasing the new material that would soon make up Loaded. The Velvets' Max's live line-up consisted of Lou Reed, Doug Yule, Sterling Morrison and Billy Yule on drums in place of Tucker, who would not return from maternity leave until after Reed's departure. Reed's last live performance with the band at Max's was recorded and would be released two years later in 1972 as a live-bootleg album Live at Max's Kansas City also on Atlantic records. 

Reed's departure and release of ""Loaded"":
Disillusioned with the lack of progress the band was making, and pressured by manager Steve Sesnick, Reed decided to quit the band during the last week of Max's Kansas City shows in August 1970. While ""Loaded"" was finalized & mixed, it wasn't yet mastered and wasn't set to be released by Atlantic until November of that year. Lou Reed has often said he was completely surprised when he saw Loaded in stores. He also said, ""I left them to their album full of hits that I made"". 
Reed was perturbed about a verse being edited from the Loaded version of ""Sweet Jane"". ""New Age"" was changed as well: as originally recorded, its closing line (""It's the beginning of a new age"" as sung by Yule) was repeated many more times. A brief interlude in ""Rock and Roll"" was also removed. (For the 1995 box set Peel Slowly and See, the album was presented as Reed intended; the ""Fully Loaded"" two-disc edition also features the full versions of ""Sweet Jane"" and ""New Age"".) On the other hand, Yule has pointed out that the album was to all intents and purposes finished when Reed left the band and that Reed had been aware of most, if not all, of the edits. 

Loaded touring: The Doug Yule years (1970-1973):
With manager Steve Sesnick looking to fill bookings (following the departure of Lou Reed), and with the pending release of Loaded in November 1970, the band, now featuring Sterling Morrison on guitar, Maureen Tucker on drums, Walter Powers on bass, with Doug Yule taking over lead vocals and guitar, went on the road once more to promote the album, playing shows around the U.S. East Coast and Europe. In early 1971 the line-up of Yule, Morrison, Tucker and Powers recorded two studio demos together titled ""She'll Make You Cry"", and ""Friends"", both of which remained unreleased. Sterling Morrison had obtained a bachelor of arts degree in English, and left the group in August 1971, to pursue a Ph.D. in medieval literature at the University of Texas at Austin. He had packed an empty suitcase and when the time came for the band to return to New York City, he told them at the airport that he was staying in Texas and quitting the band - the last founding member to quit. His replacement was singer/keyboard player Willie Alexander. This line up of the band, albeit with no original members, played several shows in England, Wales, and the Netherlands to support the 1971 European release of Loaded, some of which are collected on the 2001 box set Final V.U. 
In 1972 Atlantic released Live at Max's Kansas City, the live bootleg of the Velvet Underground's final performance with Reed, (also featuring Doug Yule, Morrison, and Billy Yule) recorded by a fan, Brigid Polk, on August 23, 1970. Meanwhile, the Doug Yule-fronted version of the band was touring the United Kingdom when Sesnick managed to secure a recording contract with Polydor Records in England. He then allegedly sent Tucker, Powers and Alexander back to the US (effectively ending their tenures with the group) while Yule recorded the album Squeeze under the Velvet Underground name virtually by himself, with only the assistance of Deep Purple drummer Ian Paice and a few other session musicians in an unspecified London studio. 
Prior to the release of Squeeze, a new Velvet Underground lineup was assembled to tour the UK to promote the upcoming album. This version of the Velvet Underground consisted of Yule, Rob Norris on guitar, George Kay (Krzyzewski), bass guitar, and Mark Nauseef, drums. Sesnick left the band shortly before the tour started, and Yule left when the brief tour ended in December 1972. 
Squeeze was released a few months later in February 1973, in Europe only. The album is generally held in low regard by fans and critics: Stephen Thomas Erlewine notes that the album received ""uniformly terrible reviews"" upon initial release, and was often ""deleted"" from official V.U. discographies. When asked about Squeeze, Yule hinted that band manager Steve Sesnick orchestrated the album purely as a money ploy. ""Sesnick dumped the second iteration of the band in England with no money and no equipment and just left us there to find our way back. He gave me six copies of Squeeze as pay. I never got any money. When you sign with ASCAP or BMI you get an advance. He not only made an arrangement with them but actually signed me and took the money."" 
Despite the mixed critical reviews of the album upon its initial release, the UK band Squeeze took their name from its title according to band member Chris Difford, who offered the following opinion of the album in a 2012 interview: ""It's an odd record, but the name came from that, definitely. ... In a retrospective way I really enjoy it. It has kind of a naivety about it"" 
Although Yule had theoretically put an end to the Velvet Underground in late 1972, in early 1973 a band featuring him, Billy Yule on drums, Kay on bass and Don Silverman, guitar (he later changed his name to Noor Khan), played the New England bar circuit, and was incorrectly billed as ""The Velvet Underground"" by the tour's manager. The band members objected to the billing and according to Yule, the promoter was not supposed to bill the band as the Velvet Underground. In late May 1973, the band and the tour manager parted ways, thus finally bringing the Velvet Underground to an end, three years after Reed's departure. 

Post-VU developments (1972-1990):
Reed, Cale and Nico teamed up at the beginning of 1972 to play a concert in Paris at the Bataclan club. This concert was bootlegged, and finally received an official release as Le Bataclan '72 in 2003. 
Before that, Cale and Nico had developed solo careers. Nico had also begun a solo career with Cale producing a majority of her albums. Reed started his solo career in 1972 after a brief sabbatical. Sterling Morrison was a professor for some time, teaching Medieval Literature at the University of Texas at Austin, then became a tugboat captain in Houston for several years. Maureen Tucker raised a family before returning to small-scale gigging and recording in the 1980s; Morrison was in several touring bands, including Tucker's band. 
Yule subsequently toured with Lou Reed and played on the latter's Sally Can't Dance album, and Yule (at Reed's request) also contributed guitar and bass tracks to Reed's album Coney Island Baby, that can be heard in the Bonus Edition of the album (which was released in 2002). Yule then became a member of American Flyer, then dropped out of the music industry altogether before reappearing in the early 2000s. 
In 1985 Polydor released the album VU, which collected unreleased recordings that might have constituted the band's fourth album for MGM in 1969 but had never been released. Some of the songs had been recorded when Cale was still in the band. More unreleased recordings of the band, some of them demos and unfinished tracks, were released in 1986 as Another View. 
On July 18, 1988, Nico died of a cerebral hemorrhage following a bicycle accident. 
Czech dissident playwright Václav Havel was a fan of the Velvet Underground, ultimately becoming a friend of Lou Reed. Though some attribute the name of the 1989 ""Velvet Revolution"", which ended more than 40 years of Communist rule in Czechoslovakia, to the band, Reed pointed out that the name Velvet Revolution derives from its peaceful nature--that no one was ""actually hurt"" during those events. Reed has also given at least one radio interview where he stated that it was called the Velvet Revolution because all of the dissidents were listening to the Velvet Underground leading up to the overthrow, and this music was an inspiration for the events that followed. After Havel's election as president, first of Czechoslovakia and then the Czech Republic, Reed visited him in Prague. On September 16, 1998, at Havel's request, Reed performed in the White House at a state dinner in Havel's honor hosted by President Bill Clinton. 

Reunions, death of Sterling Morrison and Hall of Fame induction (1990-1996):
In 1990, Reed and Cale released Songs for Drella, dedicated to Andy Warhol who had recently died. (""Drella"" was a nickname Warhol had been given, a combination of ""Dracula"" and ""Cinderella"".) Though Morrison and Tucker had each worked with Reed and Cale since the V.U. broke up, Songs for Drella was the first time the pair had worked together in decades, and rumors of a reunion began to circulate, fueled by the one-off appearance by Reed, Cale, Morrison and Tucker to play ""Heroin"" as the encore to a brief Songs for Drella set in Jouy-en-Josas, France. Lou Reed and Sterling Morrison also joined John Cale for an encore at his show at New York University on December 5, 1992. 
The Reed-Cale-Morrison-Tucker lineup officially reunited as ""The Velvet Underground"" in 1992, commencing activities with a European tour beginning in Edinburgh on June 1, 1993, and featuring a performance at Glastonbury which garnered an NME front cover. Cale sang most of the songs Nico had originally performed. As well as headlining (with Luna as the opening act), the Velvets performed as supporting act for five dates of U2's Zoo TV Tour. With the success of the Velvet Underground's European reunion tour, a series of US tour dates were proposed, as was an MTV Unplugged broadcast, and possibly even some new studio recordings. Before any of this could come to fruition, Cale and Reed fell out again, breaking up the band once more. 
On August 30, 1995, Sterling Morrison died of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma after returning to his hometown of Poughkeepsie, New York, at age 53. When the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, Reed, Tucker, and Cale reformed the Velvet Underground for the last time. Doug Yule was absent. At the ceremony, the band was inducted by Patti Smith, and the trio performed ""Last Night I Said Goodbye to My Friend"", written in tribute to Morrison. 

New York Public Library reunion and current years:
In December 2009, to commemorate the 45th anniversary of the band's formation, Reed, Tucker and Yule (with Cale not present) gave a rare interview at the New York Public Library. 
The Velvet Underground continues to exist as a New York-based partnership managing the financial and back catalog aspects for the band members. In January 2012, the surviving members of the band initiated legal action against the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts over unauthorised use of the debut album's banana design. 

Death of Lou Reed:
On October 27, 2013, Lou Reed died at his home in Southampton, New York, aged 71. He had undergone a liver transplant earlier in the year. John Cale responded to Reed's passing by saying ""The world has lost a fine songwriter and poet...I've lost my 'school-yard buddy'"". 

Legacy:
The Velvet Underground have been considered among the most influential bands in rock history. Their legacy has stretched into alternative and experimental rock. Their first four albums were included in Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. They were ranked the 19th greatest artist by the same magazine and the 24th greatest artist in a poll by VH1. In 1996 they were inducted into The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Critic Robert Christgau considers them ""the number three band of the '60s, after the Beatles and James Brown and His Famous Flames"".

The band currently resides in Cambridge.  Under-Hamilton studied English Literature; the other three Fine Art.  In their second year of studies, Newman showed Sainsbury a handful of his own songs inspired by his guitar-playing dad and hallucinogens, and the pair began recording in their dorm rooms with Sainsbury acting as producer on Garageband.   First as Daljit Dhaliwal and then as Films, the four friends spent the next two years playing around town.  Their eponymous first 4-track demo ∆, was recorded with producer Charlie Andrew in London and showcased the tracks ""Breezeblocks"", ""Hand-Made"", ""Matilda"" and ""Tessellate"". A 7"" containing ""Bloodflood"" and ""Tessellate"" was released by Loud and Quiet on October 2011.  Their first 2012 release for Infectious was the triangle shaped 7"" ""Matilda"" / ""Fitzpleasure"", followed by ""Breezeblocks"" as an advance of their first album An Awesome Wave, released on 25 May 2012. That same year, they won the prestigious Barclaycard Mercury Prize for An Awesome Wave.  On January 2014, Sainsbury announced that he had left the band. ""Hunger of the Pine"" premièred in June, as an advance of their sophomore album This Is All Yours released at the end of September.  http://altjband.com, alt-J (also known as ∆) is an English indie rock band formed in 2007 in Leeds, by Gwil Sainsbury (guitar/bass), Joe Newman (guitar/lead vocals), Gus Unger-Hamilton (keyboards/vocals) and Thom Green (drums). 
The band's debut album An Awesome Wave was released in May 2012 in Europe and September 2012 in the United States, and won the 2012 British Mercury Prize. Gwil Sainsbury amicably departed the band in early 2014. Their second album, This Is All Yours, was released on 22 September 2014 and went straight to UK number one. As a replacement for Sainsbury, Cameron Knight became a support member for alt-J's live shows, playing guitar, bass and sampler. 

History:

Formation and early years: 2007-10:
alt-J (∆) was formed when Gwil Sainsbury (guitar/bass), Joe Newman (guitar/lead vocals), Gus Unger-Hamilton (keyboards/vocals) and Thom Green (drums) met at Leeds University in 2007. Unger-Hamilton (younger brother of Ferdy, head of A&R for Polydor Records) studied English, the other three Fine Art. According to Newman ""I basically went to art school to start a band."" 
In their second year of studies, Newman showed Sainsbury a handful of his own songs and, inspired by his guitar-playing dad, the pair began recording on GarageBand in their hall rooms with Sainsbury acting as producer. The band's unusual sound stems from the fact that due to living in student halls, where noise had to be kept to a minimum, they were unable to use bass guitars or bass drums. Thom Green suffers from Alport syndrome, a rare genetic disease which causes hearing and kidney failure. As a result, he is now about 80 percent deaf. 

An Awesome Wave and touring: 2011-12:
After graduating the band moved to Cambridge, where they spent a number of months working on their music before signing a deal with Infectious Records in December 2011. Their self-titled 4-track demo EP, ∆, was recorded with producer Charlie Andrew in London and featured the tracks ""Breezeblocks"", ""Hand-Made"", ""Matilda"", and ""Tessellate"". A 7"" single containing ""Bloodflood"" and ""Tessellate"" was released by Loud and Quiet in October 2011. Their first 2012 release for Infectious Records was the triangle-shaped 10"" ""Matilda""/""Fitzpleasure"". It was followed by ""Breezeblocks"" which preceded their first album.An Awesome Wave was also produced by Charlie Andrew and compiled at Iguana Studios, Brixton, where the band recorded tracks during the studio's spare time. Their debut album was released on 28 May 2012 in the UK, Europe, and Australia, and on 18 September 2012 in North America via Canvasback Music. The album received largely favourable reviews and was described as a ""captivating blend of insatiable grooves and profound poignancy"". 
alt-J supported Wild Beasts in April 2012 and played a minor headlining tour around the United Kingdom and Ireland in October of that year. The band have featured regularly on summer festivals, including Latitude, Bestival, Reading and Leeds, T in the Park, Green Man, Pukkelpop, and Lowlands. They also did concert tour in the United States in December 2012 and performed at the Laneway Festival tour in Australia. In November 2012 the band were announced as the winners of the Mercury Prize for their album. Besides the prize-money, the band saw an increase in their profile resulting in An Awesome Wave reaching 13 in the UK album chart. The band would later descirbe the event as ""life-changing, there was a sense of being imposters, that the band had somehow got this far without not being a real band, we're just guys from Leeds who muddled through it and magicked a Mercury award"". 

Departure of Sainsbury and This Is All Yours: 2013-present:
Gwil Sainsbury left alt-J as of 13 January 2014. It was announced on Twitter that he had decided to leave, but the band would continue, stating that they were to still be best friends with Gwil. In early June 2014, alt-J announced a 2014 tour to take place in North America over October and November. The 23-day tour started in Vancouver, B.C. on October 14 and ended in Washington, D.C. on November 19. On 9 June 2014, they announced their second album This Is All Yours, that was released on 22 September 2014. This Is All Yours went straight to Number 1 on the UK's Official Albums Chart. It was announced that Alt-J will headline the September 2015 edition of Boston Calling Music Festival. 

Name:
The band's symbol is the delta sign, ∆, which is traditionally used in scientific study to indicate ""change"" or ""difference"". The ∆ symbol can be typed on an Apple Mac with the key sequence Alt+J (on certain keyboard layouts). ""alt-J"" were formerly known as both ""Daljit Dhaliwal"" and ""Films"", but were later forced to change to ""Alt-J"" because an American band called ""The Films"" already existed. 

Contributions:
The band produced the song ""Buffalo"" for the David O. Russell film Silver Linings Playbook, starring Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence. 
Several of their tracks, including ""Something Good"" and ""Fitzpleasure"", have been used for BBC 2's channel idents. ""Fitzpleasure"" was also featured at the end of the season 8 episode, ""Allosaurus Crush Castle"" of the television series Weeds. In mid-2013, Nokia used the track ""Fitzpleasure"" in their commercial for the Lumia 925 in Europe and Lumia 928 in the United States. ""Fitzpleasure"" was also used in the UK trailer for The Way, Way Back, and was featured in an episode of the television series ""Broad City"" Season 1 Episode 1. ""Tessellate"" was featured at the beginning of Sons of Anarchy Season 6 Episode 5. Their songs were used in multiple episodes of Scrotal Recall, with ""Breezeblocks"" and ""Left Hand Free"" in the second episode and ""Every Other Freckle"" in the third. 
In February 2013 the band announced they would be composing the soundtrack for Toby Jones' new film Leave To Remain. 
The song ""Something Good"" was used for the soundtrack of the 2015 video game Life Is Strange. 
The song ""Fitzpleasure"" is also used in a trailer for the upcoming 2015 video game ""Battleborn"". 

Awards:
In 2012, alt-J's debut album won the British Mercury Prize. alt-J were also nominated for three Brit Awards (British Breakthrough Act, British Album of the Year and British Group of the Year).An Awesome Wave was announced as BBC Radio 6 Music Album of the Year 2012. Three of the tracks from this album gained entry into the Australian 2012 Triple J Hottest 100, with ""Something Good"" at number 81, ""Tessellate"" at number 64, and ""Breezeblocks"" coming third overall. In 2013, An Awesome Wave won Album of the year at the Ivor Novello Awards.

The band comprises bassist/vocalist Troy Sanders, guitarist/vocalist Brent Hinds, guitarist Bill Kelliher and drummer/vocalist Brann Dailor. They have released six full-length albums to date, expanding their musical borders from early raw sludgy riffs to later psychedelic multi-layered songs, yet maintaining progressive style with unusual time signatures and odd instrumentation.  It was announced, in late 2005, that, having fulfilled contractual obligations to indie label, relapse records, Mastodon had been offered a deal by a major music label, a spot on the Warner Music roster. Despite this, however, relapse records released a DVD, and re-released the band's only demo.  An album titled Call of the Mastodon, comprising the material recorded for the band's first and only untitled demo, which featured Eric Saner on vocals, was released in early 2006. A DVD entitled ""The Workhorse Chronicles"" was released not long after and a full length album, the band's Warner Music debut, Blood Mountain, was released September 12th, 2006. In an interview with MTV news, Brann Dailor revealed that the band's sound, on this upcoming release would be decidedly different and more ""progressive."" He also expressed excitement over the possibility of the birth of a new ""prog movement,"" naming bands such as Isis, along with Mastodon, as prospective leaders of said movement.  Blood Mountain met critical acclaim with reviews ranging from Metal Hammer and Kerrang! who stated it was as good or better than their last release Leviathan, while other critics view it as the essential release of the decade and UK Metal Hammer named it best album of '06. Blood Mountain also featured guest appearances by Scott Kelly of Neurosis on the track ""Crystal Skull"", Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age on ""Colony of Birchmen"", as well as The Mars Volta's keyboardist Isaiah ""Ikey"" Owens on ""Pendulous Skin"" and singer Cedric Bixler-Zavala on ""Siberian Divide"".  Mastodon's fourth album Crack the Skye was released on March 24, 2009 as a normal version and a deluxe version (which includes all songs in instrumental versions as well as their normal versions). The album is produced by Brendan O'Brien, and Scott Kelly of Neurosis returns as a guest musician on the title-track. The band had debuted three new tracks at the Bonnaroo Music Festival, but did not play anymore live before the album's release, due to fears of internet distribution and wanting to play the songs to the right audience. In a MusicRadar interview, guitarist Bill Kelliher confirmed that the album is about an ""out of body experience,"" and looks at the concepts of astral travel, wormholes, Stephen Hawking's theories and the spiritual realm. Drummer Brann Dailor has a section of vocals on the song ""Oblivion"" following the intro and chorus. The band has announced that they will play the album in its entirety incorporating a stage show on their upcoming tour. Mastodon was a headliner at the Scion Rock Fest on February 28, 2009, performing a set containing three tracks from Crack The Skye, the first time these songs were played since being finalized and recorded. Scott Kelly made an appearance performing his guest vocals for the songs ""Crack the Skye,"" ""Aqua Dementia,"" and ""Crystal Skull.""  Mastodon's fifth album The Hunter was released on September 26, 2011 in the UK and one day later in the US via Reprise Records. The Hunter Songfacts says that the album was titled in honor of guitarist/vocalist Brent Hinds' brother, Brad, who unexpectedly passed away while hunting in December 2010. Mastodon actually had two working titles for the album in honor of Brad: ""The Hunter"" or ""Brother.""  Mastodon have previously appeared on the second stage at Ozzfest 2005 and have toured with the likes of Slayer, Lamb of God and Children of Bodom on the Unholy Alliance US tour and have 3 songs recorded live on the accompanying tour DVD.

History:

Formation, early years and Remission (2000-2003):
Mastodon was formed on January 13, 2000 after drummer Brann Dailor and guitarist Bill Kelliher moved to Atlanta from Victor, New York and met bassist/singer Troy Sanders and guitarist/singer Brent Hinds at a High on Fire show. They discovered they had a mutual appreciation of sludge metal bands Melvins and Neurosis and '70s hard-rockers Thin Lizzy, and shortly thereafter formed Mastodon. In an interview in 2009, Kelliher revealed that the first time Hinds attended a practice with the band, he ""showed up so wasted he couldn't play"". 
The band recorded a demo in 2000, which featured the band's first lead singer, Eric Saner on vocals. Saner left the band for personal reasons after just a couple of months. After recording a four song demo and a 7-inch picture disc through Reptilian Records, Mastodon landed a record deal with Relapse Records in 2001. They released an EP, Lifesblood, in 2001, and their first full-length album, Remission, was released in 2002, with the singles ""March of the Fire Ants"" and ""Crusher/Destroyer"" (which was also featured on Tony Hawk's Underground).

Leviathan & Call of the Mastodon (2004-2005):

Their second full-length album, Leviathan, was released in 2004. It is a concept album loosely based on Herman Melville's novel Moby-Dick.

Leviathan was followed by the 2006 release of Call of the Mastodon, a remastered collection of the band's first nine songs, and a DVD of interviews and concert footage called The Workhorse Chronicles that includes material from the band's early days as a five-piece. The band has stated that ""Call of the Mastodon"" is their third studio album even though the album is a compilation album.

In a MusicRadar interview, guitarist Bill Kelliher confirmed the album is about an ""out-of-body experience"", and looks at the concepts of astral travel, wormholes, Stephen Hawking's theories and the spiritual realm. The album follows a quadriplegic who learns astral projection. On his journey he flies too close to the sun, burning his umbilical cord which connects him to his body, and flies into oblivion. At the same time in Czarist Russia, Rasputin and his cult were channeling spirits and brought the quadriplegic to their time. He explains his situation and foretells the assassination of Rasputin. Inevitably Rasputin is assassinated and Rasputin guides him back to his body. The band had debuted three new tracks at the Bonnaroo Music Festival, but did not play any more live shows before the album's release, due to fears of internet distribution and wanting to play the songs to the right audience. Drummer Brann Dailor sings lead vocals for the verses of the song ""Oblivion."" Mastodon was a headliner at the Scion Rock Fest on February 28, 2009, performing a set containing three tracks from Crack the Skye, the first time these songs were played since being finalized and recorded. On May 15, 2009, Mastodon performed a shortened version of ""Oblivion"" on the Late Show with David Letterman. 

In order to support their new album, Mastodon toured with Metallica on the latter part of the 2009 European leg of their World Magnetic Tour. In Fall of 2009, they embarked with Dethklok on the ""Adult Swim Presents"" tour along with Converge and High on Fire. On October 17, 2009, they recorded a DVD documenting the tour at the Aragon Ballroom in Chicago. Mastodon played the alternative music festival Big Day Out, touring across Australia and New Zealand in January and February 2010. 
On October 29, 2009, they performed ""Divinations"" on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. 
On November 4, 2009, Mastodon released their second EP, entitled Oblivion. 
Teaming up with bands Deftones and Alice in Chains, Mastodon went on tour in September 2010 in the United States and Canada. The tour was called Blackdiamondskye, a portmanteau of the three bands' latest albums (Black Gives Way to Blue, Diamond Eyes, and Crack the Skye). 
Film director Jimmy Hayward contacted the band during their 2009 tour of Europe and expressed how much listening to Blood Mountain had helped his creative process while finishing a screenplay, and he offered Mastodon a chance to score the film he had been working on - Jonah Hex. In an interview with Paste magazine, bassist Troy Sanders said that Hayward ""called us out of the blue as a fan. It was the most beautiful, authentic way to collaborate."" Mastodon used scenes from the film as inspiration during the writing and recording process, and the instrumental soundtrack, Jonah Hex: Revenge Gets Ugly EP, was released on June 29, 2010, through Reprise Records. 
In 2010, the band was confirmed as being part of the soundtrack for Namco Bandai Games' 2010 remake of Splatterhouse. The game's protagonist can also be seen wearing a Mastodon T-shirt in certain flashback cutscenes. 
On March 15, 2011, Mastodon released their first live DVD/CD entitled Live at the Aragon through Reprise. The recording features the entire performance of their fourth studio album, Crack the Skye, along with songs from their previous records. 

The Hunter (2011-2012):

The Hunter, Mastodon's fifth studio album was recorded at Doppler Studios in Atlanta with producer Mike Elizondo. The first hints of the new album were given by the band via Facebook in January 2011. Drummer Brann Dailor revealed during interviews the title of the band's new album and described the new material as not so much proggy as riff-oriented and ""a little more stripped down"". 
Meanwhile, the band performed in many major summer festivals. and on June 28, 2011, Mastodon released through Adultswim.com a leftover track from the ""Crack the Skye""' sessions called ""Deathbound"". 
The first taste of The Hunter came in July 2011 where Mastodon released via YouTube the song ""Black Tongue"", set to a video of AJ Fosik creating the sculpture used for the album cover. By August 12, the band had revealed the track listing from the Hunter and debuted ""Curl Of The Burl"", the first official single from the new album. Mike Elizondo was chosen to produce the album which marks his first time working with the band. It was also announced that a deluxe edition would be released. It featured the two bonus tracks ""The Ruiner"" and ""Deathbound"" and a different cover. 
On September 6, Mastodon released a third song from The Hunter, ""Spectrelight"", featuring Scott Kelly of Neurosis. 
On September 16, the band released a 53-minute custom visualizer with all of the album tracks, 11 days prior to the release of ""The Hunter"". In support of the album a North American headline tour was announced. The album was very well received by fans and the media. It also performed strongly on the official charts, rising to number ten on the Billboard top 200, which is their best placement to date. On October 5, 2011, they performed ""Curl of the Burl"" on Late Show with David Letterman. 
On October 12, a UK tour was announced that will run through February 2012 with fellow bands The Dillinger Escape Plan and Red Fang as support acts. They were at Later... with Jools Holland where they performed ""Black Tongue"" & ""Curl of the Burl"". A seventeen date European tour was announced that featured dates in Scandinavia, Germany, France, Spain, Belgium, Portugal, Italy, the Netherlands and Latvia. 
On December 1, ""Curl of the Burl"" was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category Best Metal/Hard Rock performance. It is the band's second nomination with the first being for ""Colony of Birchmen"" in 2007. 
The record was named ""Album of the Year"" by Metal Hammer, Classic Rock and Rock Sound. In January 2012 ""Dry Bone Valley"" was released as the third single of the album. 
In January it was announced that Mastodon and Swedish prog metal band Opeth will tour together in a joint tour across North America. It was named the ""Heritage Hunter Tour"" after both bands latest releases, The Hunter and Heritage. The bands will take turns of the headlining spot. Support will come from the Swedish heavy metal band Ghost. On February 11, 2012, the band performed a sold-out show at the Brixton Academy in London, it was the band's biggest headline show ever. Dry Bone Valley"" was released on February 13 as the third single of the album. A music video for the song was also released. 
On April 21, 2012, to commemorate Record Store Day, Mastodon released two separate vinyls. The first is a split 7″ with Feist titled Feistodon. Mastodon will cover Feist's ""A Commotion"" and Feist will cover Mastodon's ""Black Tongue"". The pair released a one of a kind interactive, crossfading music video for the song 'A Commotion'. The second release was a cover of The Flaming Lips' ""A Spoonful Weighs a Ton"". 
The band spent the summer performing at festivals across Europe and South America. It was the last tour in support of The Hunter. 

Once More 'Round the Sun (2014-2015):
Mastodon began recording again in early 2013. Guitarist Brent Hinds described the new music as ""really eerie"" and ""very spooky-sounding"", and stated that he has written three new songs. On December 3, 2012, the band announced via their Twitter page that they were writing a song for the film Monsters University. However, the song used in the film was the previously released ""Island"". They will also be part of the 2013 Rockstar Energy Mayhem Festival. On May 6, 2013, the band stated that they are ""...VERY busy writing and putting songs together for the next studio MASTODON album...""  In an interview on Fri, Jul 26, Brann Dailor was reported as saying that the band would ""probably go into the studio end of September"". The band is also playing at the 2014 Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival. 

On February 27, Brann Dailor told in the interview that their sixth album would be released in summer of 2014, and he also stated that the band would release an EP in winter of 2014. Some of the confirmed tracks are: ""Tread Lightly"", ""Buzzard's Guts"", ""Scent of Bitter Almonds"", ""High Road"" and ""Aunt Lisa"". 
In an interview with Troy Sanders in Paste Magazine released on April 3, he revealed the album was called Once More 'Round the Sun and had 15 tracks. He also confirmed that Mastodon recorded 90 minutes of material, but only 60 minutes of it will be present on the album; the unreleased material possibly might be released on an EP later in 2014. A few more tracks that have been confirmed are: ""Diamonds in the Witch House"" (which has Scott Kelly from Neurosis on a guest vocal appearance), and ""Ember City"". 
In an interview on April 11, Brann revealed the album will release in June. 
On April 17, the first single ""High Road"" was made available for streaming. 
On 26 April, Bill Kelliher revealed the title of the second single ""Chimes at Midnight"". 
As of June 16, 2014, the entire album is streaming on iTunes. 
The album was released on June 24, 2014 through Reprise Records. The album sold around 34,000 copies in the United States in its first week of release to land at position No. 6 on The Billboard 200 chart making it the bands first consecutive top 10 debut, with their previous album, The Hunter, peaking at No.10 after opening with 39,000 copies in 2011. 

Upcoming album (2015-present):
On January 18, 2015, it was reported that Brent Hinds is working on new Mastodon album, showing a picture with him playing the 13 string pedal steel. The same report was later confirmed by Troy Sanders, who stated: ""Every record that we do is gonna sound different, because we always want to evolve and create our own musical path. And every record will be different. We do not wanna write the same record twice."" 
On March 12, 2015, Mastodon released a new track called ""White Walker"", which will appear on the upcoming Game of Thrones: Catch the Throne Vol. 2 mixtape to promote the fifth season of the HBO TV series Game of Thrones. Dailor, Hinds, and Kelliher also appeared in episode 8 of the season as wildlings. This mixtape will also feature songs by various other acts, ranging from Killswitch Engage to Snoop Dogg. 

Characteristics:

Musical style:

Mastodon cross multiple heavy metal genres such as progressive metal,sludge metal,experimental metal,stoner metal,alternative metal and groove metal. James Christopher Monger of Allmusic describes Mastodon as ""one of the more notable New Wave of American Heavy Metal acts, a genre spawned in the mid-'90s by bands like Pantera, Biohazard, and Machine Head, Mastodon's innovative, lyrically astute blend of progressive metal, grindcore, and hardcore helped position the band as one of the preeminent metal acts of the early 21st century."" 
Bassist Troy Sanders stated about their musical style: 
"" 
We don't consider ourselves a metal band. We recognize there is a lot of metal in us, but we also want to believe we have a lot of rock 'n' roll in us, and we have a lot of progressive rock in us, we have bits and pieces of thrash and punk, and psychedelic-ness sprinkled throughout. A lot of times for me personally, just having the metal tag itself seems kind of limiting on us because we have such an appreciation for all styles of music and we like to incorporate bits and pieces of those into our songs. But we also recognize all the different subgenres and the millions of times people say, ""Oh, what do they sound like?"" and you say something, I understand that. But, it doesn't affect how we create anything at all. 
"" 
 Scott Kelly of Neurosis has performed vocals on every Mastodon album excluding Remission. 
Mastodon's musical style has evolved much from their earliest pre-Remission releases to The Hunter. Their early work is significantly heavier and more abrasive than their later work, primarily or exclusively using harsh vocals, more distorted instruments, and more atypical song structures; this is especially prominent in their earliest work. The release of Mastodon's third studio album Blood Mountain, which incorporates both clean and harsh vocals, marked a shift in the vocal styles used, with subsequent albums favouring clean vocals almost exclusively. 

Lyrical themes:
Over its first four albums, Mastodon had specific concepts in mind, specifically the classical elements of fire, water, earth, and air.Remission does not deal with a particular theme but it is loosely based on the theme of fire. Songs like ""Crusher Destroyer"", ""Where Strides the Behemoth"" and ""Ol'e Nessie"" deal with the theme of fictional creatures. 
Leviathan is about the novel Moby-Dick. It centers around the main characters and their thoughts during the story. 
Blood Mountain is about a man who is searching for the ""Crystal Skull"", which is on top of the ""Blood Mountain"". According to bassist Troy Sanders, ""It's about climbing up a mountain and the different things that can happen to you when you're stranded on a mountain, in the woods, and you're lost. You're starving, hallucinating, running into strange creatures. You're being hunted. It's about that whole struggle."" 
Crack the Skye deals with many different themes. The title is a tribute to ""Skye"", the little sister of drummer Brann Dailor, who committed suicide at the age of fourteen. Themes touched on within the album include ""dark magic(k), astral travelling and the role of Rasputin in the downfall of Czarist Russia"". 
The Hunter does not deal with an entire concept like their earlier work, but is remarked by the band to have an attachment to the Chinese classical element of wood. Songs such as ""Spectrelight"" or ""Black Tongue"" seem to have no meaning related to this theme, although the former seems to have themes of redemption and trusting oneself while the latter focuses on pain and betrayal. Meanwhile, songs such as ""Dry Bone Valley"" (especially) and ""Octopus Has No Friends"" are seemingly cut from a concept album. The title is a tribute to Hinds's brother, Brad Hinds, who died of a heart attack on December 4, 2010 while out hunting. 

Visual art:

Artwork:

Artist Paul Romano was responsible for all of the band's album art and backdrops up to 2011. The artwork for the band's 5th studio album The Hunter was made by AJ Fosik, a wood carver who was also responsible for the backdrop the band used live at the time. Oakland-based artist Skinner, who, in his own words, specializes in ""psychedelic nightmare paintings"", has taken the reins on Once More 'Round the Sun. ""It's going to be a work of art for sure. It's going to be very eye-opening"", said bassist Troy Sanders before the album's released. ""Very striking. It's from another dimension, and a lot of our music is geared toward that idea--taking you to another planet on songs. It's out there, and I think it's incredible."" 

Live presentation:
Following their first tours in the early 2000s, Mastodon have performed at many major festivals such as Download, Roskilde, Coachella, Bonnaroo, Big Day Out, Rock Werchter, Pinkpop, Metaltown, Ottawa Bluesfest, Sonisphere and Soundwave. When performing the band has traditionally had a fairly lo-fi visual presentation. However, during the band's ""Crack The Skye Tour"" (2009-2010), they used a large screen behind the drumkit showing a visual show. 

Legacy and reception:
The ""sludge/stoner/alternative metal outfit"" Mastodon, as labelled by Allmusic, is ""one of the preeminent metal acts of the early 21st century"". The BBC stated about Mastodon: ""They might be bonkers of lyric, full of fantasy mumbo jumbo, but the band is unashamedly committed to its complex-of-composition craft, and the results have frequently stunned ever since their 2002 debut, Remission. They are the most ambitious, most fearless, most fun heavy metal band to have breached the mainstream since the genre oozed its way out of The Midlands in the 1970s.""Alternative Press has stated: ""Mastodon are one of the all-time great hard-rock groups.""Rolling Stone stated: ""Mastodon are the greatest metal band of their generation -- no one else comes close.""

They are influenced musically by progressive rock bands such as King Crimson, Yes, Dream Theater, and Genesis, as well as heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden. The band also identifies The Police, The Beatles, Pink Floyd, and Led Zeppelin as primary influences. However, there really isn't a style of popular music that Umphrey's does not cover. Artists covered in concert by Umphrey's range from Lionel Richie to Metallica to Toto to Snoop Dogg to Paul Simon.  Formed at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana in December 1997 by guitarist/vocalist Brendan Bayliss, bassist Ryan Stasik, keyboardist Joel Cummins, and drummer Mike Mirro, Umphrey's McGee combined members of Tashi Station and Stomper Bob, two popular Notre Dame rock bands.   In mid-1998, the band released their debut album complete with a tongue-in-cheek title, Greatest Hits Vol. III. The group decided to record an album immediately because it was easier to get live gigs with an official CD. Long out of print, the album contains many of Umphrey's future concert warhorses, such as Divisions and All In Time.  Shortly after the release of the album, the band added a fifth member, percussionist Andy Farag. Farag's father became the band's agent, and a second pressing of Greatest Hits Vol. III featured Farag in the album's inner sleeve and credits. By the end of the year, Umphrey's McGee, along with peers Ali Baba's Tahini, were one of the most popular bands in the South Bend/Notre Dame area. They began performing outside of the area at colleges and house parties, allowing listeners to tape and trade their music freely. By 1999, the band had gained notoriety outside of Indiana, especially with the release of the live album Songs For Older Women, which featured live tracks recorded over a two-night stand in November 1998.  The addition of Jake Cinninger in September 2000 helped bring the band's musical dynamic to a new level. Cinninger, an accomplished guitarist, brought a distinct heaviness to the Umphrey's sound, as well as a large repertoire of original music, much of which comprised the bulk of the catalog from his previous band, Ali Baba's Tahini. The band also adopted several songs written by Ali Baba's Tahini frontman Karl Engelmann (who now fronts Asheville-based rock band Mother Vinegar). Another live album, One Fat Sucka, was released shortly after, containing live performances recorded in the summer and fall of 2000.  Around 2001, the band began practicing intense improvisational exercises. One of their first productive jam sessions took place in a hotel in the ""Jimmy Stewart Ballroom"" during the wedding of fan/website designer Jeremy Welsh. Therefore, the band began to call their onstage improvisational excursions ""Jimmy Stewart."" This form of improvisation differs in approach from the methods utilized by many of their jam band peers and has been extensively outlined by ""McL"" in the ""Jimmy Stewart writeup"" on the fan message board known as ""The Bort"" at www.umphreaks.com.  2002 saw the release of the band's first proper recording, Local Band Does OK. That summer, Umphrey's was invited to play the first annual Bonnaroo Music Festival which took place in rural Manchester, TN, and featured over 30 bands performing in front of nearly 100,000 people. Umphrey's played to their largest audience to date and ended up selling more CDs than any other artist on the bill including Widespread Panic, Trey Anastasio, and Norah Jones.  In October 2002 drummer Mike Mirro announced he was leaving to attend medical school. After hundreds of tapes were reviewed by percussionist Andy Farag, the band settled on the first one they received, which was from Kick the Cat drummer Kris Myers, who has a masters degree in jazz drumming from DePaul University.    In 2004, the band released the critically-acclaimed album Anchor Drops, recorded in several different studios throughout the Chicago area. Shortly before the release of the album, the band scored a distribution deal for both Anchor Drops and Local Band Does OK, and for the first time, Umphrey's music was available in stores all over the country. Anchor Drops received rave reviews from several high-profile magazines. Umphrey's was booked to play the Bonnaroo Music Festival once again in June but unlike their 2002 performance, this time they would play a coveted late-night spot. The band performed to over 20,000 people, many of whom had never heard the band before. Shortly after in July, Umphrey's was declared by Rolling Stone Magazine to ""have become odds-on favorites in the next-Phish sweepstakes.""   In April 2006, Umphrey's released their fourth studio effort, Safety in Numbers. They appeared on the late night TV program Jimmy Kimmel Live in May and were featured at many of the major U.S. festivals throughout the summer, playing 129 shows before a three-night stand in Chicago for New Year's Eve. The Bottom Half, an album of leftover tracks from the Safety in Numbers sessions, was released a year later in April, 2007. It was supported with tours of the U.S., Europe, and Japan.    A live double-album titled Live at the Murat was released in October, 2007. The album was recorded over 2 nights at the Egyptian Room in the Murat Centre in Indianapolis, Indiana on April 6-7, 2007. It received a 4-star review from Rolling Stone Magazine. The album also won a Jammy for best live album. Another live double album release came in June 2008, when the band put out Jimmy Stewart 2007. The album consisted entirely of live, improvised ""Jimmy Stewart"" sessions recorded in 2007.  Umphrey's McGee completed work on their next studio album, Mantis, in late 2008. Recorded mainly in Manny Sanchez's I.V. Lab Studios in Chicago, the band members began by presenting each other with CDs containing hundreds of musical ideas they'd composed over the past dozen years, which were then shifted and trimmed down to the concise tracks that appear on the album. The band's longtime sound caresser, Kevin Browning, edited and mixed the album's material.   Mantis became available for pre-order on October 27, 2008. Along with the pre-order announcement came information that unique bonus content would be available and more content would unlock depending on how many pre-orders were placed. This unusual method of distribution has been hailed as the ""perfect way to implement a pre-order campaign"" by Reuters.com.  Mantis was released on January 20, 2009.

The band also identifies The Police, The Beatles, and Led Zeppelin as primary influences. UM experiments with many genres including rock, metal, funk, jazz, blues, electronic, bluegrass, and folk. 

History:

Early years (1997-2000):

Formed at the University of Notre Dame in December 1997 by guitarist/vocalist Brendan Bayliss, bassist Ryan Stasik, keyboardist Joel Cummins, and drummer Mike Mirro, Umphrey's McGee combined members of Tashi Station and Stomper Bob, two Notre Dame rock bands. Early concerts consisted of both originals and cover songs, including Guns N' Roses' ""Patience"" and Vince Guaraldi's Peanuts theme ""Linus and Lucy"" as well as songs by Phish, moe., and The Grateful Dead. According to Cummins, ""The name originated from a distant relative of Brendan's who shares a similar namesake. We've altered the name slightly."" 
In mid-1998, after only 8 months together, the band released their debut album, Greatest Hits Vol. III. Having a released studio disc allowed them to more readily book live performances. Though long out of print, the album contains songs that remain staples of Umphrey's live sets, such as ""Divisions"", ""Phil's Farm"", ""FF"", and ""All in Time"". 
Shortly after the release of the album, the band added a fifth member, percussionist Andy Farag. Farag's father became the band's agent, and a second pressing of Greatest Hits Vol. III featured Farag in the album's inner sleeve and credits. By the end of the year, Umphrey's McGee, along with peers Ali Baba's Tahini, were one of the most popular bands in the South Bend/Notre Dame area. They began performing outside of the area at colleges and house parties, allowing listeners to tape and trade their music freely. In 1998, the band released their first live album, Songs for Older Women. 
Guitarist Jake Cinninger was added to the band in September 2000. Cinninger brought a heaviness to the Umphrey's sound, as well as a large repertoire of original music, much of which comprised the bulk of the catalog from his previous band, Ali Baba's Tahini. The band also adopted several songs written by Ali Baba's Tahini frontman Karl Engelmann (who now fronts Asheville-based rock band Mother Vinegar). Shortly after Cinninger's arrival, the band released another live album, One Fat Sucka, which contained live performances recorded in the summer and fall of 2000. 

Full line-up with Mike Mirro (2001-2002):
In 2001, the band began practicing intense improvisational exercises. One of their first productive sessions took place in a hotel in the ""Jimmy Stewart Ballroom"", prompting the band to call their onstage improvisational excursions ""Jimmy Stewart"". This form of improvisation differs in approach from the methods utilized by many of their jam band peers. 
Jake Cinninger and Joel Cummins released solo albums in 2001 and 2002, respectively. At least two songs from each of those albums have made their way into Umphrey's concert repertoire. 
June 2002 saw the release of the band's first proper recording, Local Band Does OK. That summer, the first annual Bonnaroo Music Festival took place in rural Manchester, Tennessee, and featured over 30 bands performing in front of nearly 100,000 people. Umphrey's played to their largest audience to date. The band sold more CDs than any other artist on a bill that included Widespread Panic, Trey Anastasio, and Norah Jones. 
The band almost broke up in late 2002 when drummer Mike Mirro announced he was leaving the band to attend medical school. After hundreds of audition tapes were reviewed by the percussionist Andy Farag, the band settled on the first one they received, which was from Kick the Cat drummer Kris Myers. 

Current line-up (2003-present):
2003 was a year of change for UM. New drummer Kris Myers had to learn their extensive repertoire of originals and covers. The band continued their grueling tour schedule, logging over 150 shows for the year. The band began experimenting with a new ""Lego"" style of songwriting which involved piecing together original sections and lifted pieces of ""Jimmy Stewart"" improvisations to create new songs, such as Ocean Billy, #5, and Wife Soup. That summer, UM entered the recording studio in Chicago for their first studio album with Myers. In the Fall, the UM Live program was started by ""Sound Caresser"" Kevin Browning. Each night's show would be offered on CD, for sale directly after the show. This soon translated into a partnership with Disc Logic for online distribution, and a few years later all of the band's shows would be moved to UMLive.net. In November, the band released their first DVD, Live from the Lake Coast, and later that month their first official release featuring Kris Myers, Local Band Does Oklahoma (Recorded on April 23 in Oklahoma City). 
In 2004, the band released Anchor Drops, recorded in several different studios throughout the Chicago area. Shortly before the release of the album, the band scored a distribution deal for both Anchor Drops and Local Band Does OK, and for the first time, Umphrey's McGee music was available in stores all over the country. The album received rave reviews from several high-profile magazines. Once again, Umphrey's headed to Bonnaroo, playing a coveted late-night spot. The band performed to over 20,000 people, many of whom had never heard the band before. In July, the band was declared by Rolling Stone Magazine to ""have become odds-on favorites in the next-Phish sweepstakes."" 
Starting in 2005, the band began producing Umphrey's McGee Podcasts, an effort to provide fans with highlights of recent shows. Each podcast is around 75 minutes in length and is released about twice a month, and it has 20,000 listeners. ""In the Kitchen"" won the Jammy Award for Song of the Year. That evening, the band performed with Huey Lewis for the first time (they were also joined by Mavis Staples, Sinead O'Connor, and Jeff Coffin). That summer, the band participated in the Big Summer Classic tour, which was the first time UM played Red Rocks. 
On April 4, 2006, Umphrey's released their fourth studio effort, Safety In Numbers. They appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! alongside Huey Lewis in support of the new album on May 18, 2006. The band was featured at many of the major U.S. festivals throughout the summer, playing 129 shows before a three-night stand in Chicago for New Year's Eve. The Bottom Half, a 2-disc album compiled from the Safety in Numbers sessions, was released a year later on April 3, 2007. Near the end of 2006, Umphrey's began a program to provide complimentary tickets to audience tapers in exchange for them distributing the recordings digitally online. 
A live double-album titled Live at the Murat was released on October 16, 2007. The album was recorded over 2 nights at the Egyptian Room in the Murat Centre in Indianapolis, Indiana on April 6-7, 2007. It received a 4-star review from Rolling Stone magazine. The album also won a Jammy for best live album. 
The band's 2008 Halloween show was the first to feature a mash-up theme. Riffing on the idea of mash-ups popularized by DJs, they arrange new composition from 2-3 songs (a mix of covers and originals). This tradition has continued on Halloween every year since. 
Mantis was released on January 20, 2009. The album concentrated more on the progressive style that was associated with Anchor Drops. Unlike previous albums, most of the songs went unplayed until the album was released. Later in the year, Jefferson Waful took over duties as lighting director. 
In 2010, the band debuted UMBowl, an interactive concert in 4 sets (or quarters), each with a different themes. Ticket purchasers are sent ballots to vote for the selections for two quarters, while the other two quarters are based upon interactive text submissions/votes. October 3 saw the debut of the Stew Art (S2) events. Each S2 event, limited to 50 fans, was an hour-long event that had the band improvising based upon text submissions from the audience. The S2 has since become a regular feature for UMBowl. 
The band's seventh studio album Death By Stereo, was released September 13, 2011. The album features a mix of new songs as well as old songs that the band has used in their live rotation for years, such as ""Hajimemashite"" and ""The Floor"". With the album's pre-order came a set of packages for super fans, including fishing trips and bar crawls with the band. The Bill Graham For A Day option for a private show became a reality, and has since inspired several follow-up events. 
In 2013, the band debuted ""Headphones and Snowcones"", a program available at their concerts which provides a soundboard feed delivered to a set of headphones via wireless receiver. 
Original drummer Mike Mirro died on January 30, 2014, at age 36. 
On June 10, 2014, UM released their eighth studio album, Similar Skin, their first album released on their new music label Nothing Too Fancy Music. 
On April 7, 2015, UM released their ninth studio album, The London Session, an album recorded in one day at Abbey Road Studios.

The band currently consists of Colin Meloy (vocals, guitar), Chris Funk (guitar, mandolin, dulcimer, pedal steel guitar), Jenny Conlee (organ, piano, accordion), Nate Query (electric bass, acoustic bass, cello) and John Moen (drums). Notable former members include Rachel Blumberg (drums, vocals) and Jesse Emerson (bass). The band's most recent album, The King Is Dead was released on 17 January 2011.  Named both in reference to the Russian Decembrist Revolt (they use the national anthem of the Soviet Union as an introduction at many concerts) and to the atmosphere associated with the month of December, the Decemberists write songs that range from upbeat pop to instrumentally lush ballads. They often employ instruments like the accordion, Hammond organ, Wurlitzer organ, and upright bass. In their lyrics, they eschew the angst and introspection common to modern rock, instead favoring a storytelling approach, as evidenced in songs such as ""My Mother Was a Chinese Trapeze Artist"" from the 5 Songs EP and ""The Mariner's Revenge Song"" on Picaresque. Their songs convey tales ranging from whimsical (""Here I Dreamt I Was an Architect"") to epic (""The Tain"") to truly dark (""Odalisque""). They often invoke historical events and themes from around the world. Early in their career, The Decemberists' musical and lyrical aesthetics frequently prompted critics to compare them to Neutral Milk Hotel. Since their debut, their sound has undergone a consistent evolution, most notably in the direction of progressive rock with a strong folk influence, though they have also been described as indie rock and, by Stephen Colbert, as ""hyper-literate prog rock."" For example, one song, ""When the War Came"", uses a little-known story from the Siege of Leningrad to describe the heroism of civilian scientists during warfare. The lyrics state: ""We made our oath to Vavilov / We'd not betray the solanum / The acres of asteraceae / To our own pangs of starvation"". Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov was a Russian botanist whose laboratory, a seedbank containing 200,000 types of plant seeds, many of them edible, was preserved throughout the siege, during which hundreds of thousands of people died.  In March 2005, the Decemberists were reportedly the first band to distribute a music video via BitTorrent -- the self-produced ""16 Military Wives"" (from Picaresque). That same month, the band's equipment trailer was stolen; fans contributed to a replacement fund, and another fund-raiser was organized via an eBay auction, with buyers bidding for copies of Colin Meloy Sings Morrissey and original art work by Carson Ellis. They also received help from Lee Kruger, The Shins, The Dandy Warhols and other musicians. The Martin Guitar Company offered six- and twelve-string guitars on permanent loan. In early April, police discovered the trailer in Clackamas, Oregon, and a fair amount of the band's merchandise, but the instruments and equipment were not recovered.  On 12 December 2005, Meloy revealed to Pitchfork Media that they had signed to Capitol Records, and planned to begin recording their major label debut with producers Tucker Martine and Chris Walla, of Death Cab for Cutie fame, in April 2006. The Decemberists' first album on Capitol, and their first major label debut, The Crane Wife, was released on 3 October 2006. The release was accompanied by an appearance the same day on the world-wide syndicated TV talk show Late Night with Conan O'Brien when the track ""O Valencia!"" was performed. The Decemberists began their tour in support of The Crane Wife, with The Rout of the Patagons Tour, on 17 October 2006, at Portland, Oregon's Crystal Ballroom. Their opening act was Lavender Diamond. Later on in the tour, Alasdair Roberts opened for the band.  In July 2007 the Decemberists set out on a five-date tour with a full orchestral accompaniment. On 7 July, the tour put the group on the stage of the historic Hollywood Bowl for the first time in their career, and they were joined by the Los Angeles Philharmonic.  On 15 July the group performed with The Mann Festival Orchestra at The Mann Center for the Performing Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They then played a free concert in Chicago, Ilinois, at the recently developed Millennium Park with the Grant Park Symphony Orchestra. In September 2007 they also played at Austin City Limits Music Festival in Austin, Texas.  In October 2007, they began The Long and Short of It Tour. However, having completed the European portion of the tour and immediately after playing the Chicago dates, the rest of the tour was canceled due to illness.  On 24 March 2009, the band released The Hazards of Love, their fifth album. The album's first single, ""The Rake's Song"", was made available for free on the band's website. The album featured guest appearances from My Brightest Diamond, Becky Stark of Lavender Diamond, Robyn Hitchcock and Jim James. The album peaked at #14 on the Billboard 200.  On 11 January 2011, the band released their sixth album The King Is Dead. The band released the first single ""Down by the Water"" for free on their website. The album debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 album chart in the United States and is the highest charting album in the band's career.

The band consists of Colin Meloy (lead vocals, guitar, principal songwriter), Chris Funk (guitar, multi-instrumentalist), Jenny Conlee (keyboards, piano, Hammond organ, accordion), Nate Query (bass), and John Moen (drums). 
The band's debut EP, 5 Songs, was self-released in 2001. Their seventh full-length album What a Terrible World, What a Beautiful World was released on January 20, 2015, by Capitol Records, and is the band's fourth record with the label. 
In addition to their lyrics, which often focus on historical incidents and/or folklore, The Decemberists are also well known for their eclectic live shows. Audience participation is often a part of each performance, typically during encores. The band stages whimsical reenactments of sea battles and other centuries-old events, typically of regional interest, or acts out songs with members of the crowd. 
In 2011, the track ""Down By the Water"" from the album The King Is Dead was nominated for Best Rock Song at the 54th Grammy Awards. 

Musical style:

The group's songs range from upbeat pop to instrumentally lush ballads, and often employ instruments like the accordion, Hammond organ, Wurlitzer organ, and upright bass. In its lyrics, the band eschews the introspection common to modern rock, instead favoring a storytelling approach, as evidenced in songs such as ""My Mother Was a Chinese Trapeze Artist"" from the 5 Songs EP and ""The Mariner's Revenge Song"" on Picaresque. The band's songs convey tales ranging from whimsical (""The Sporting Life"") to epic (""The Tain"") to dark (""Odalisque"", ""The Rake's Song"") to political (""16 Military Wives"", ""Valerie Plame""), and often invoke historical events and themes from around the world (""Yankee Bayonet"", ""Shankill Butchers""). 

Influences and character:
On their website, the group claim that their official drink is Orangina, that they love the video game Bioshock and ""adore"" the bands Norfolk & Western, Explosions In The Sky, The Postal Service, The Long Winters, Death Cab for Cutie, Dokken, Tycho, El Ten Eleven, The Shins, The Octopus Project, Electrelane, Camera Obscura, Clearlake, The Thermals, Modest Mouse, Swords and Earlimart. The band's official biography, keeping up their reputation for grandiloquence, also describes how they met in a Turkish bath. A footnote following the biography claims, ""The Decemberists travel exclusively by Dr. Herring's Brand Dirigible Balloons."" Colin Meloy has listed Anne Briggs, Nic Jones, and Shirley Collins - who led the 1960s British folk revival - as major influences on The Hazards of Love. Meloy has also confessed a ""slavish love"" for Morrissey, one of his principal influences. The band has also cited their liking for Siouxsie and the Banshees, and the pop tunes of R.E.M. and XTC. The band also draws inspiration from British and Irish folk music. 

History:

2000: Formation:
The Decemberists formed in 2000 when Colin Meloy left his band Tarkio in Montana and moved to Portland, Oregon. There he met Nate Query, who introduced Meloy to Jenny Conlee (they had played together in the band Calobo) and the three scored a silent film together. Playing a solo show prior to meeting Query, Meloy met Chris Funk. Funk was a fan of Tarkio and played pedal steel on the first two Decemberists releases, not ""officially"" becoming a member until the third effort. The band's first drummer, Ezra Holbrook, was replaced by Rachel Blumberg after Castaways and Cutouts, who in turn was replaced by John Moen after Picaresque. The band's name refers to the Decembrist revolt, an 1825 insurrection in Imperial Russia. Meloy has stated that the name is also meant to invoke the ""drama and melancholy"" of the month of December.5 Songs, the band's debut extended play, was self-released in 2001. The members at that time played for several hours in a McMenamins hotel the night before to raise the money needed to record in the studio the next day. This originally served as a demo tape and the five songs on it (minus ""Apology Song"") were recorded in under two hours. 

2003-2005: Kill Rock Stars:
After releasing its first full record, Castaways and Cutouts, on Hush Records, the group moved onto the Kill Rock Stars recording label. After the re-release of Castaways, Her Majesty the Decemberists was released in 2003. In 2004, the band released ""The Tain,"" an eighteen-and-a-half minute single track based on the Irish mythological epic Táin Bó Cúailnge. The band's final album with Kill Rock Stars was Picaresque, which was recorded in a former church. 
In March 2005, the band distributed a music video via BitTorrent, the self-produced ""16 Military Wives"" (from Picaresque). In the same month, the band's equipment trailer was stolen; fans contributed to a replacement fund, and another fundraiser was organized via an eBay auction, with buyers bidding for copies of Colin Meloy Sings Morrissey and original artwork by Carson Ellis. The band also received help from Lee Kruger, the Shins, The Dandy Warhols, and other musicians. C.F. Martin & Company offered 6- and 12-string guitars on permanent loan. In early April, police discovered the trailer and a portion of the band's merchandise in Clackamas, Oregon, but the instruments and equipment were not recovered. 

2005-2006: Capitol Records debut and The Crane Wife:
On December 12, 2005, Meloy revealed to Pitchfork Media that the band had signed to Capitol Records, and planned to begin recording their major label debut with producers Tucker Martine and Chris Walla (of Death Cab for Cutie) in April 2006. The band's first album on Capitol, The Crane Wife, was released on October 3, 2006. The release was accompanied by an appearance the same day on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, during which the band performed ""O Valencia!"". The supporting tour (called ""The Rout of the Patagons Tour"") began on October 17, 2006, at Portland, Oregon's Crystal Ballroom. The opening act was Lavender Diamond. Later in the tour, Alasdair Roberts opened for the band. In 2006, The Crane Wife was voted NPR listeners' favorite album of the year, as announced on the December 5 episode of All Songs Considered, and it remains one of the Decemberists' most critically acclaimed records. 
In November 2006, the band encouraged fans to create a music video for the single ""O Valencia!"" using footage of the band in front of a green screen. On his Comedy Central program, Stephen Colbert started a mock feud with the band, claiming his ""green screen challenge"" came first; the band countered that its 2005 on-stage lightsaber fight in San Francisco preceded Colbert's idea. The feud culminated in a December 20 guitar solo competition on Colbert's show, with lead guitarist Funk representing the band. After Colbert feigned a hand injury, Peter Frampton took over for Colbert and won an audience vote. Show guests got involved, with New York Governor-elect Eliot Spitzer and Dr. Henry Kissinger declaring, ""Tonight, I think the American people won."" The prize for winning the challenge was revealed to be a copy of The Crane Wife. According to Meloy, the Colbert challenge was not scripted, though the band was told that Frampton would step in for Colbert. 

2007: ""A Bit of Grass-Stain Does Not a Ruined Pair of Jeans Make"" tour:
In July 2007, the band embarked on a five-date tour with a full orchestral accompaniment. On July 7, the tour put the band on the stage of the historic Hollywood Bowl for the first time, pairing them with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. On July 15, the band performed with The Mann Festival Orchestra at the Mann Center for the Performing Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where they debuted a new song. The band then played a free concert in Chicago at the Millennium Park with the Grant Park Symphony Orchestra. 
On October 6, 2007, the band announced the cancellation of the remainder of their European tour, citing the ill health of a band member. On November 1, 2007, the band further canceled the remaining 28 shows of their ""Long and Short of It"" tour. 

2008: Always the Bridesmaid:
The members of The Decemberists appeared, individually billed (as ""Colin Meloy, Chris Funk, Jenny Conlee, Nate Query, and John Moen""), to perform in support of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama at a rally at the Tom McCall Waterfront Park in Portland, Oregon, on May 18, 2008. On October 14, 2008 the band began releasing a series of singles called Always the Bridesmaid; a volume was released every month until the end of the year. The band also took up a limited tour in support of the singles, including an appearance on Late Night with Conan O'Brien. 

2009: The Hazards of Love:
The Hazards of Love was released on March 24, 2009 on Capitol Records, under Red Light Management (Jason Colton and Ron Laffitte). It was made available for download on iTunes one week earlier, on March 17, 2009. The track ""The Rake's Song"" was put up for download on The Decemberists website in advance of the album's release. During Meloy's 2008 U.S. tour, he played several new songs that were included on the album. The album was produced by Tucker Martine. 
In a post on Rolling Stone's ""Rock 'n' Roll Daily"" blog, the band revealed more details about the album. The original plan was for The Hazards of Love to be a staged musical. However, it seems that the story was ""unstageable"" in such a format. Instead the band played the entire album start to finish at each concert on the spring tour. A press release read: ""The album began when Meloy - long fascinated by the British folk revival of the 1960s - found a copy of revered vocalist Anne Briggs's 1966 EP, titled The Hazards of Love. Since there was no actual song with the album's title, he set out to write one, but was soon immersed in something much larger. The Hazards of Love tells the tale of a woman named Margaret; her shape-shifting lover, William; his fey forest queen mother; and a cold-blooded, lascivious rake, who recounts with spine-chilling ease how he came ""to be living so easy and free"" in ""The Rake's Song"". Lavender Diamond's Becky Stark and My Brightest Diamond's Shara Worden deliver the lead vocals for the female characters, while My Morning Jacket's Jim James, Robyn Hitchcock and The Spinanes' Rebecca Gates appear in supporting roles. The range of sounds reflects the characters' arcs, from the accordion's singsong lilt in ""Isn't it a Lovely Night?"" to the heavy metal thunder of 'The Queen's Rebuke/The Crossing.'"" 
On February 9, 2009, the Decemberists announced in a newsletter to fans that they would be embarking on the first leg of the ""A Short Fazed Hovel"" Tour 2009 starting on May 19 in Los Angeles at the Hollywood Palladium. The newsletter included a complete list of dates for the first leg of the tour ending on June 14 at the Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival in Manchester, Tennessee. On Monday April 27, the band performed a shortened version of ""The Wanting Comes in Waves/Repaid"" on The Colbert Report. 
On August 14, 2009, the Decemberists played in Pittsburgh, PA at the Benedum Center. During the show, the band members performed a skit where they ran up and down the aisles participating in a fictitious battle at Fort Pitt. 
On September 19, 2009, The Decemberists played a ""lottery show"", originally billed as a ""by request"" show, at Terminal 5 in New York City. The setlist was composed of songs drawn from a large bingo turner kept on stage. The master of ceremonies for the evening was singer/songwriter John Wesley Harding and the opening act was Laura Veirs and the Hall of Flames. The randomized setlist included ""July, July!"", ""Yankee Bayonet (I Will Be Home Then)"", ""The Tain I-V"", ""Annan Water"", ""The Crane Wife 3"" and ""The Island/Come and See/The Landlord's Daughter/You'll Not Feel the Drowning"", and an original song, as a bingo ball suggested, called ""Miracle on the Hudson"". 
In 2009, The Decemberists also contributed the song ""Sleepless"" to the AIDS benefit album Dark Was the Night, which was produced by the Red Hot Organization. 
During their European tour in the winter of 2010, the band performed ""The Mariner's Revenge Song"" at the conclusion of each date. The audience was encouraged to scream as if they were being consumed by a whale mentioned in the track's narrative while the band pretended to die on stage. 

2010-2011: The King Is Dead and hiatus:
The Decemberists remained off tour as they embarked on a new studio album. On September 4, 2010, the band opened for Neko Case and the headliner, Bob Dylan, the first day of the Bumbershoot Arts and Music Festival in Seattle, WA. There, they announced that they were wrapping up recording of a new album and debuted three of its tracks. The King Is Dead was released on January 14, 2011, with Peter Buck of R.E.M. contributing instrumentation to three of its songs. Colin Meloy later affirmed that R.E.M. had been an inspiration during the writing and recording of some of the album's material. ""Down by the Water,"" a track from the new album, was released via the band's official site on November 2, and was immediately available on iTunes as a free download. The song would later be nominated for Best Rock Song at the 54th Grammy Awards. The King Is Dead debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in the United States upon its release, the first time a Decemberists album would achieve this. As compared to the band's previous work, which was influenced by the music of the British folk revival, The King Is Dead was more influenced by traditionally American genres including country, blues, and Americana. 
The Decemberists' ""Popes of Pendarvia World Tour"" in support of The King Is Dead began with a show on January 25, 2011 at Beacon Theatre in New York City. The tour, which included engagements throughout the U.S., Canada, and Europe, ended on August 26 at the McMenamins Edgefield in Troutdale, Oregon. During the tour, on May 3, it was announced on The Decemberists' official site that Jenny Conlee had been diagnosed with breast cancer and would miss most of the band's remaining tour dates while receiving treatment and recovering. In support of their bandmate, the band designed a 'Team Jenny' charity t-shirt for the Yellow Bird Project to raise money for Planned Parenthood. Conlee would later make a full recovery after her cancer went into remission. 
Meanwhile, on April 7, 2011, the band released a music video for their song ""This Is Why We Fight"". Directed by Aaron Stewart-Ahn, the video depicts a band of teenagers living in a bleak, post-apocalyptic society. Disgusted with the tyrannical rule of their ""king"", one boy and one girl lead a splinter group away from the camp. Outraged, the king and his forces attack, but the video cuts to black before any resolution can be seen. In August, an eight-song set was released on iTunes featuring six previously released tracks and two new covers: Leonard Cohen's ""Hey, That's No Way To Say Goodbye"" and the Fruit Bats' ""When U Love Somebody."" Later that month, a new music video was debuted for the track entitled ""Calamity Song"". The video depicts a game, played on a tennis court by children, of simulated thermonuclear war as described in the ""Eschaton"" scene of David Foster Wallace's novel Infinite Jest. 
Meloy announced during the ""Popes of Pendarvia"" tour that the group would take a multi-year hiatus once the touring cycle was over. To cap off this period of activity, the band released the follow-up outtake EP Long Live the King on November 1, 2011, as well as a live album from their tour for The King is Dead titled We All Raise Our Voices to the Air (Live Songs 04.11-08.11) on March 13, 2012. In addition, the band recorded a song for The Hunger Games soundtrack, called ""One Engine"". The soundtrack, The Hunger Games: Songs from District 12 and Beyond, was released on March 20, 2012. 
While on hiatus, the group's only activity as The Decemberists was a cameo appearance on the 7th episode in the 24th season of The Simpsons, in which the band was rendered in the show's traditional style of animation and presented as the hip, new music teachers of Springfield Elementary. As well, the episode's theme music was performed with the signature folk flair of The Decemberists. 

2014-2015: What a Terrible World, What a Beautiful World:
During a solo tour in 2013, Meloy announced that the Decemberists would end their hiatus and begin working on a new album within the next year. The hiatus officially concluded on March 5, 2014, with the announcement of two headlining shows at Portland's Crystal Ballroom, the band's first shows in three years, where they played their debut album, Castaways and Cutouts, in its entirety. Additionally, The Decemberists were the mystery band for the 2014 Boston Calling Music Festival, where they played on Saturday, May 24. On April 24, further establishing their return, the band performed on the Season 6 finale of the NBC comedy series Parks and Recreation. 
On November 3, 2014, ""Make You Better"", the band's first single off the new album, was released, and on January 20, 2015, the band's seventh studio album, What a Terrible World, What a Beautiful World, was released. To commemorate both the release of the new album and the Decemberists' success as a whole, January 20th was officially declared ""Decemberists Day"" in the group's hometown of Portland, Oregon by mayor Charlie Hales. 
In support of the album, the band made late-night appearances on Jimmy Kimmel Live! and Conan, and on February 11 embarked on a European tour which included dates in Ireland, the UK, The Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, and Italy. A North American tour began on March 21, 2015 in the band's hometown of Portland, Oregon.

Comprised only of his stark vocals, guitar and searing lines such as ""and I'm the only one believing/ there's nothing to believe in"", it was a bleak but brilliant treatise on the inchoate frustration and fury of youth, rubbed raw and laid bare.   On November 8, 2011, under his King Krule alias, he released a self-titled EP on True Panther Sounds.  His music has been likened to Morrissey and Edwyn Collins. Stylistically he has been described as darkwave and is inspired by disparate influences such as Gene Vincent, Fela Kuti and The Penguin Cafe Orchestra. Archy also makes music under the moniker DJ JD Sports and Edgar The Beatmaker, the styles of which are significantly different than King Krule.

King Krule released his debut album 6 Feet Beneath the Moon on 24 August 2013., Named after the Donkey Kong Country character King K. Rool, ..., As King Krule, 18 year old south-east London based singer/producer/songwriter ..., Archy Marshall (born 24 August 1994), more commonly known by his stage name King Krule, is an English singer-songwriter, producer and musician. After a hectic and troubled childhood, he began recording music in 2010. He has released several EPs, and his debut full-length album, 6 Feet Beneath the Moon, came out in 2013 to positive reviews. His music is difficult to classify, with elements of various genres like punk jazz, hip hop, darkwave, and trip hop. 

Life and career:
Marshall's childhood was divided between his working-class, tolerant mother in East Dulwich and his strict father in Peckham. He claims to have suffered ""a lot of weird shit"" during this time, and at age 13 he began refusing to go to school. His parents were threatened with prison terms if they could not get him to attend again; he did not until his father dragged him there. He implied in an interview with The Guardian that he was diagnosed with at least one mental illness during this time and hated the medical system as a result. He also had insomnia, leading him to stay up late at night listening to Pixies and The Libertines, which inspired him to create ""soundscapes."" 
Marshall studied at Forest Hill School and then at the Brit School for three years between 2008 and 2011. In July 2011, Archy began playing under a new moniker, King Krule, at a festival in Hyères, France. His stage name is inspired by the film King Creole and not King K. Rool, the character from the Donkey Kong video game series. 
He had released his debut single Out Getting Ribs under his Zoo Kid moniker on House Anxiety records in April 2010, recorded and mixed in his bedroom with his friends Francis North and Thelonious McCabe. 
On 8 November 2011 he released a self-titled EP as King Krule on True Panther Sounds. 
Archy also makes music under the moniker DJ JD Sports and Edgar the Beatmaker, the styles of which are significantly different from King Krule. 
On 9 December 2012, the BBC announced that he had been nominated for the Sound of 2013 poll. 
King Krule released his debut album 6 Feet Beneath the Moon on 24 August 2013. More than 50% of all tracks were already released on his precedent EPs. This brought him to prominence especially in the USA with performances on Conan and the Late Show with David Letterman. In October of the same year he embarked on a European tour, which was the last time he has appeared in the UK on tour to date. Following the success of this tour he then moved on to a tour of North America. 
His most recent activity in terms of new solo releases to date is a video for A Lizard State released on 8 January 2014 which gained over 800,000 views on YouTube. After a short break he went on to tour Europe once again, inexplicably missing out on his homeland of the United Kingdom, which was his most recent public performance. 
In February 2014, King Krule appeared on the cover of The Fader in its 90th issue. 

Musical style and influences:
Many reviewers and journalists have noted King Krule's unusual transcendence and appropriation of disparate genres. His music has been described mainly with jazz derivatives such as punk jazz and jazz fusion, but also as darkwave,post-punk, and hip hop. Writers have also noted elements of trip hop,jazz rap, and dub in individual songs of his. Jason Lymangrover of Allmusic states that his songs are mainly in the form of ballads with major seventh chords, but by contrast there is also a ""grittiness"" to Archy's voice and persona, portraying him as ""the type of kid who would be quick to throw a punch without asking questions."" 
His music has been likened to Morrissey and Edwyn Collins.

First popular in Europe, they quickly became successful in North America during the ""British Invasion"" of the mid-60s. Since then, their worldwide sales are estimated at more than 200 million albums. In 1989, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and in 2004, they ranked number 4 in Rolling Stone magazine's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. In 2008, Billboard magazine ranked the Rolling Stones at number ten on ""The Billboard Hot 100 Top All-Time Artists"", and as the second most successful group in the Billboard Hot 100 chart.  The group was formed by Brian Jones, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Ian Stewart, who met as schoolmates in Dartford, Kent. They took their name from a Muddy Waters song called ""Rollin' Stone Blues"", and made their live debut at London's Marquee Club (minus Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts). They start playing pubs and clubs around the city and suburbs. Bill Wyman joined later that year (the popular story is that he was asked because he had his own amplifier).  In January 1963, Charlie Watts  joined the Stones. The band gigged constantly, with residencies at venues like Ealing Jazz Club, Ken Colyer's Studio 51, and Eel Pie Island in Twickenham.  Their weekly performances at the Crawdaddy at Richmond's Station Hotel resulted in ecstatic press reviews, and in April Andrew Loog Oldham saw them there and signed them to his management company the next day. He started the ""Would you let your daughter marry a Rolling Stone"" press campaign, which set the tone for their career.  In May 1963, the Stones were signed to Decca Records by the same man who had turned down the Beatles. A month later ""Come On"", the first Rolling Stones single, was released, and reached number two in the U.K. charts.  The fifth member of the group, Brian Jones, left on 8th June 1969, saying that he wanted to form a new group. He was replaced by Mick Taylor, formerly in John Mayall's Bluesbreakers.  In 1971 the Stones, whose contract with Decca had expired, launched their Rolling Stones Records label.  In December 1974 Taylor left the group in order to pursue a solo career.  He was replaced in 1975 by Ronnie Wood.  Since Wyman left the Stones in 1993, the band has consisted of Jagger, Richards, Watts and guitarist Ronnie Wood. In studio and live performances, Darryl Jones (bassist) and Chuck Leavell (keyboardist) also serve as a regular contributors.

The first settled line-up consisted of Brian Jones (guitar, harmonica), Ian Stewart (piano), Mick Jagger (lead vocals, harmonica), Keith Richards (guitar), Bill Wyman (bass) and Charlie Watts (drums). Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued as occasional pianist until his death in 1985. Jones departed the band less than a month prior to his death in 1969, having already been replaced by Mick Taylor, who remained until 1975. Subsequently, Ronnie Wood has been on guitar in tandem with Richards. Following Wyman's departure in 1993, Darryl Jones has been the main bassist. Other notable keyboardists for the band have included Nicky Hopkins, active from 1967 to 1982; Billy Preston through the mid 1970s (most prominent on Black and Blue) and Chuck Leavell, active since 1982. The band was first led by Jones but after teaming as the band's songwriters, Jagger and Richards assumed de facto leadership. 
The Rolling Stones were in the vanguard of the British Invasion of bands that became popular in the US in 1964-65. At first noted for their longish hair as much as their music, the band are identified with the youthful and rebellious counterculture of the 1960s. Critic Sean Egan states that within a year of the release of their 1964 debut album, they ""were being perceived by the youth of Britain and then the world as representatives of opposition to an old, cruel order -- the antidote to a class-bound, authoritarian culture."" They were instrumental in making blues a major part of rock and roll and of changing the international focus of blues culture to the less sophisticated blues typified by Chess Records artists such as Muddy Waters -- writer of ""Rollin' Stone"", after which the band is named. After a short period of musical experimentation that culminated with the poorly received and largely psychedelic album Their Satanic Majesties Request (1967), the group returned to its bluesy roots with Beggars' Banquet (1968) which--along with its follow-ups, Let It Bleed (1969), Sticky Fingers (1971) and Exile on Main St. (1972)--is generally considered to be the band's best work and are considered the Rolling Stones' ""Golden Age"". Musicologist Robert Palmer attributed the ""remarkable endurance"" of the Rolling Stones to being ""rooted in traditional verities, in rhythm-and-blues and soul music"", while ""more ephemeral pop fashions have come and gone"". 
The band continued to release commercially successful records in the 1970s and sold many albums, with Some Girls (1978) and Tattoo You (1981) being their two most sold albums worldwide. In the 1980s, a feud between Jagger and Richards about the band's musical direction almost caused the band to split but they managed to patch their relationship up and had a big comeback with Steel Wheels (1989), which was followed by a big stadium and arena tour. Since the 1990s, new recorded material from the group has been increasingly less well-received and less frequent. Despite this, the Rolling Stones have continued to be a huge attraction on the live circuit, with big stadium tours in the 1990s and 2000s. By 2007, the band had made what were then four of the top five highest-grossing concert tours of all time (Voodoo Lounge Tour (1994-95), Bridges to Babylon Tour (1997-99), Licks Tour (2002-03) and A Bigger Bang Tour (2005-07). 
The Rolling Stones were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004. Rolling Stone magazine ranked them fourth on the ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"" list, and their estimated album sales are above 250 million. They have released twenty-nine studio albums, eighteen live albums and numerous compilations. Let It Bleed (1969) was their first of five consecutive number one studio and live albums in the UK. Sticky Fingers (1971) was the first of eight consecutive number one studio albums in the US. In 2008, the band ranked 10th on the Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists chart. In 2012, the band celebrated its 50th anniversary. 

History:

Early history:
Keith Richards and Mick Jagger were childhood friends and classmates in Dartford, Kent, until the Jaggers moved to Wilmington. Jagger had formed a garage band with Dick Taylor, mainly playing Muddy Waters, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Howlin' Wolf and Bo Diddley material. Jagger was reacquainted with Keith Richards in 1960 at Dartford railway station. The Chuck Berry and Muddy Waters records that Jagger carried revealed a common interest that prompted their musical partnership. Richards joined Jagger and Taylor at frequent meetings at Jagger's house. The meetings switched to Taylor's house in late 1961, where the three were joined by Alan Etherington and Bob Beckwith. They called themselves The Blue Boys. 
In March 1962, the Blue Boys read about the Ealing Jazz Club in newspaper Jazz News and visited the place on 7 April 1962. The band members met Brian Jones there, as he sat in playing slide guitar with Alexis Korner's seminal London rhythm and blues band, Blues Incorporated, the band that also had future Rolling Stones members Ian Stewart and Charlie Watts. Before visiting the Ealing Jazz Club, the Blue Boys had sent a tape of their best recordings to Alexis Korner, who was impressed. After a meeting with Korner, Jagger and Richards started jamming with Blues Incorporated. 
Brian Jones advertised for band mates in the Jazz News and Ian Stewart found a practice space and joined with Jones to start a rhythm and blues band playing Chicago blues. Shortly thereafter, Jagger, Taylor and Richards left Blues Incorporated to join Jones and Stewart in their effort. Also at the first rehearsal were guitarist Geoff Bradford and vocalist Brian Knight, both of whom declined to join the band citing objections to playing the Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley songs preferred by Jagger and Richards. In June 1962 the line-up was: Jagger, Jones, Richards, Stewart, Taylor, and drummer Tony Chapman. According to Richards, Jones christened the band during a phone call to Jazz News. When asked for a band name Jones saw a Muddy Waters LP lying on the floor. One of the LP's tracks was ""Rollin' Stone"". 

1962-64: Building a following:

Jagger, Richards and Jones with Stewart and Dick Taylor on bass billed as ""The Rollin' Stones"" played their first gig on 12 July 1962, at the Marquee Club, 165 Oxford Street, London. Their material included the Chicago blues as well as Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley songs. Bassist Bill Wyman joined in December 1962 and drummer Charlie Watts the following January 1963 to form the band's long-standing rhythm section. The Rolling Stones' then acting manager Giorgio Gomelsky secured a Sunday afternoon residency at the Crawdaddy Club in Richmond, which, Gomelsky said, triggered an ""international renaissance for the blues"" and was a seminal facet of Swinging London's advent. 
The Rolling Stones signed manager Andrew Loog Oldham, a publicist who was directed to the band by previous clients, the Beatles. Because Oldham had not reached majority - he was nineteen and younger than any member of the band - he could not get an agent's licence nor sign any contracts without his mother also signing. By necessity he joined with booking agent Eric Easton. Gomelsky had no written agreement with the band and was not consulted. Oldham made several changes to the band. He changed the spelling of the band name from ""the Rollin' Stones"" to ""the Rolling Stones"". He removed the s from Richards' last name saying it ""looked more pop"". Oldham also removed Stewart from the line-up. Wyman said Stewart did not fit Oldham's mould of ""pretty, thin, long-haired boys"". Stewart stayed on as road manager, playing piano on many studio tracks and on stage until his death in 1985. 
Decca Records, which had passed on signing the Beatles, gave the Rolling Stones a recording contract with very favourable terms. They got three times a new act's typical royalty rate, full artistic control of recordings, and ownership of the recording masters. The deal also let the band use non-Decca recording studios. Regent Sound Studios, a mono facility equipped with egg boxes on the ceiling for sound treatment, became the preferred facility. Oldham, who had no recording experience but made himself the band's producer, said Regent had a sound that ""leaked, instrument-to-instrument, the right way"" creating a ""wall of noise"" that worked well for the band. Due to Regent's low rates, the band could record for extended periods rather than the usual three-hour blocks then prevalent at other studios. All tracks on the first Rolling Stones UK album were recorded at Regent. 
Oldham contrasted the Rolling Stones' independence with the Beatles' obligation to record in EMI's studios, saying it made them appear as ""mere mortals ... sweating in the studio for the man"". Oldham promoted the Rolling Stones as the nasty opposites of the Beatles by having the band pose unsmiling on the cover of the first UK album. He also encouraged the press to use provocative headlines such as ""Would you let your daughter marry a Rolling Stone?"" Though Oldham initially had dressed the band in uniform suits, the band drifted back to wearing everyday clothes for public appearances. According to Wyman: ""Our reputation and image as the Bad Boys came later, completely there, accidentally. Andrew never did engineer it. He simply exploited it exhaustively"". 

""we were the first pop group to break away from the whole Cliff Richard thing where the bands did little dance steps, wore identical uniforms and had snappy patter"". - Bill Wyman 

A cover of Chuck Berry's ""Come On"" was the Rolling Stones' first single, released on 7 June 1963. The Rolling Stones refused to play it at live gigs, and Decca bought only one ad to promote the single. With Oldham's direction fan-club members bought copies at record shops polled by the charts, helping ""Come On"" rise to No.21 on the UK singles charts. Having a charting single gave the band entree to play outside London, starting with a booking at the Outlook Club in Middlesbrough on 13 July, sharing the billing with the Hollies. In Bill Wyman's book, ""Rolling With The Stones"" he incorrectly says the band played the Alcove club that night. Later in the year Oldham and Easton arranged the band's first big UK concert tour as a supporting act for American stars including Bo Diddley, Little Richard, and The Everly Brothers. This Autumn 1963 tour became a ""training ground"" for the young band's stagecraft. 
During this tour the Rolling Stones recorded their second single, a Lennon-McCartney-penned number entitled ""I Wanna Be Your Man""; it reached No.12 in the UK charts. Their third single, Buddy Holly's ""Not Fade Away"", itself based on Bo Diddley's style, was released in February 1964 and reached No. 3. 
Oldham saw little future for an act that lost significant songwriting royalties by playing songs of ""middle-aged blacks,"" limiting the appeal to teenage audiences. At Oldham's urging, Jagger and Richards co-wrote songs, the first batch of which he described as ""soppy and imitative."" Because songwriting developed slowly, songs on the band's first album The Rolling Stones, (issued in the US as England's Newest Hit Makers) were primarily covers, with only one Jagger/Richards original - ""Tell Me (You're Coming Back)"" - and two numbers credited to Nanker Phelge, the pen name for songs written by the entire group. 
The Rolling Stones' first US tour, in June 1964, was, in Bill Wyman's words, ""a disaster."" ""When we arrived, we didn't have a hit record there or anything going for us."" When the band appeared on the variety show The Hollywood Palace, that week's guest host Dean Martin mocked both their hair and their performance. During the tour they recorded for two days at Chess Studios in Chicago, meeting many of their most important influences, including Muddy Waters. These sessions included what would become the Rolling Stones' first number 1 hit in the UK: their cover of Bobby and Shirley Womack's ""It's All Over Now"". 
""The Stones"" followed James Brown & The Famous Flames in the filmed theatrical release of The TAMI Show, which showcased American acts with British Invasion artists. According to Jagger in 2003, ""We weren't actually following James Brown because there was considerable time between the filming of each section. Nevertheless, he was still very annoyed about it ..."" On 25 October, the band also appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show. Because of the initial pandemonium the Rolling Stones caused, Sullivan banned the band from his show, though they were booked for subsequent appearances in the years following. Their second LP - the US-only 12 X 5 - was released during this tour. 
The Rolling Stones' fifth UK single - a cover of Willie Dixon's ""Little Red Rooster"" backed by ""Off the Hook"" credited to Nanker Phelge - was released in November 1964 and became their second No.1 hit in the UK - an unprecedented achievement for a blues number. The band's US distributors (London Records) declined to release ""Little Red Rooster"" as a single there. In December 1964 London Records released the band's first single with Jagger/Richards originals on both sides: ""Heart of Stone"" backed with ""What a Shame""; ""Heart of Stone"" went to number 19 in the US. 

1965-67: Height of fame:

The band's second UK LP - The Rolling Stones No. 2, released in January 1965, charted at number 1 as an album, and the US version, released in February as The Rolling Stones, Now!, reached number 5. The album was recorded at Chess Studios in Chicago and RCA Studios in Los Angeles. In January/February 1965 the band played 34 shows for about 100,000 people in Australia and New Zealand. 
The first Jagger/Richards composition to reach number 1 on the UK singles charts was ""The Last Time"" (released in February 1965). it went to number 9 in the US. It was also later identified by Richards as ""the bridge into thinking about writing for the Stones. It gave us a level of confidence; a pathway of how to do it."" 
Their first international number 1 hit was ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"", recorded in May 1965 during the band's third North American tour. In recording the guitar riff with the fuzzbox that drives the song, Richards had envisioned it as a scratch track to guide a horn section. Disagreeing, Oldham released ""Satisfaction"" without the planned horn overdubs. Issued in the summer of 1965, it was their fourth UK No. 1 and first US No. 1 where it spent four weeks at the top of the Billboard Hot 100, establishing the Rolling Stones as a worldwide premier act. 

The US version of the LP Out of Our Heads (released in July 1965) also went to number 1; it included seven original songs (three Jagger/Richards numbers and four credited to Nanker Phelge). Their second international number-1 single, ""Get Off of My Cloud"" was released in the autumn of 1965, followed by another US-only LP: December's Children. 
Aftermath (UK number 1; US 2), released in the late spring of 1966, was the first Rolling Stones album to be composed entirely of Jagger/Richards songs. On this album Jones' contributions expanded beyond guitar and harmonica. To the Middle Eastern-influenced ""Paint It, Black"" he added sitar, to the ballad ""Lady Jane"" he added dulcimer, and to ""Under My Thumb"" he added marimbas. Aftermath was also notable for the almost 12-minute long ""Goin' Home"". 
The Stones' success on the British and American singles charts peaked during 1966. ""19th Nervous Breakdown"" (Feb. 1966, UK number 2, US number 2) was followed by their trans-Atlantic number-1 hit ""Paint It, Black"" (May 1966). ""Mother's Little Helper"" (June 1966) reached number 8 in the US; it was one of the first pop songs to address the issue of prescription drug abuse. 
The September 1966 single ""Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing In The Shadow?"" (UK number 5, US number 9) was notable in several respects: It was the first Stones recording to feature brass horns, the (now-famous) back-cover photo on the original US picture sleeve depicted the group satirically dressed in drag, and the song was accompanied by one of the first purpose-made promotional film clips (music videos), directed by Peter Whitehead. 
January 1967 saw the release of Between the Buttons (UK number 3; US 2); the album was Andrew Oldham's last venture as the Rolling Stones' producer (his role as the band's manager had been taken over by Allen Klein in 1965). The US version included the double A-side single ""Let's Spend the Night Together"" and ""Ruby Tuesday"", which went to number 1 in the US and number 3 in the UK. When the band went to New York to perform the numbers on The Ed Sullivan Show, they were ordered to change the lyrics of the refrain to ""let's spend some time together"". 
In early 1967, Jagger, Richards and Jones began to be hounded by authorities over their recreational drug use, after News of the World ran a three-part feature entitled ""Pop Stars and Drugs: Facts That Will Shock You"". The series described alleged LSD parties hosted by The Moody Blues and attended by top stars including The Who's Pete Townshend and Cream's Ginger Baker, and alleged admissions of drug use by leading pop musicians. The first article targeted Donovan (who was raided and charged soon after); the second instalment (published on 5 February) targeted the Rolling Stones. 
A reporter who contributed to the story spent an evening at the exclusive London club Blaise's, where a member of the Rolling Stones allegedly took several Benzedrine tablets, displayed a piece of hashish and invited his companions back to his flat for a ""smoke"". The article claimed that this was Mick Jagger, but it turned out to be a case of mistaken identity--the reporter had in fact been eavesdropping on Brian Jones. On the night the article was published Jagger appeared on the Eamonn Andrews chat show and announced that he was filing a writ for libel against the paper. 

A week later on Sunday 12 February, Sussex police, tipped off by the News of the World, who in turn were tipped off by Richards' chauffeur, raided a party at Keith Richards' home, Redlands. No arrests were made at the time but Jagger, Richards and their friend Robert Fraser (an art dealer) were subsequently charged with drugs offences. Richards said in 2003, ""When we got busted at Redlands, it suddenly made us realise that this was a whole different ball game and that was when the fun stopped. Up until then it had been as though London existed in a beautiful space where you could do anything you wanted."" On the treatment of the man responsible for the raid he later added: ""As I heard it, he never walked the same again."" 
In March, while awaiting the consequences of the police raid, Jagger, Richards and Jones took a short trip to Morocco, accompanied by Marianne Faithfull, Jones' girlfriend Anita Pallenberg and other friends. During this trip the stormy relations between Jones and Pallenberg deteriorated to the point that Pallenberg left Morocco with Richards. Richards said later: ""That was the final nail in the coffin with me and Brian. He'd never forgive me for that and I don't blame him, but hell, shit happens."" Richards and Pallenberg would remain a couple for twelve years. Despite these complications, the Rolling Stones toured Europe in March and April 1967. The tour included the band's first performances in Poland, Greece and Italy. 
On 10 May 1967, the same day Jagger, Richards and Fraser were arraigned in connection with the Redlands charges--Brian Jones' house was raided by police and he was arrested and charged with possession of cannabis. Three out of five Rolling Stones now faced drug charges. Jagger and Richards were tried at the end of June. On 31 July Jagger was sentenced to three months' imprisonment for possession of four amphetamine tablets; Richards was found guilty of allowing cannabis to be smoked on his property and sentenced to one year in prison. Both Jagger and Richards were imprisoned at that point, but were released on bail the next day pending appeal.The Times ran the famous editorial entitled ""Who breaks a butterfly on a wheel?"" in which conservative editor William Rees-Mogg surprised his readers by his unusually critical discourse on the sentencing, pointing out that Jagger had been treated far more harshly for a minor first offence than ""any purely anonymous young man"". 
While awaiting the appeal hearings, the band recorded a new single, ""We Love You"", as a thank-you for the loyalty shown by their fans. It began with the sound of prison doors closing, and the accompanying music video included allusions to the trial of Oscar Wilde. On 31 July, the appeals court overturned Richards' conviction, and Jagger's sentence was reduced to a conditional discharge. Brian Jones' trial took place in November 1967; in December, after appealing the original prison sentence, Jones was fined £1000, put on three years' probation and ordered to seek professional help. 
December 1967 also saw the release of Their Satanic Majesties Request (UK number 3; US 2), released shortly after The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.Satanic Majesties had been recorded in difficult circumstances while Jagger, Richards and Jones were dealing with their court cases. The band parted ways with producer Andrew Oldham during the sessions. The split was amicable, at least publicly, but in 2003 Jagger said: ""The reason Andrew left was because he thought that we weren't concentrating and that we were being childish. It was not a great moment really - and I would have thought it wasn't a great moment for Andrew either. There were a lot of distractions and you always need someone to focus you at that point, that was Andrew's job."" 
Satanic Majesties thus became the first album the Rolling Stones produced on their own. Its psychedelic sound was complemented by the cover art, which featured a 3D photo by Michael Cooper, who had also photographed the cover of Sgt. Pepper. Bill Wyman wrote and sang a track on the album: ""In Another Land"", which was also released as a single, the first on which Jagger did not sing lead vocal. 

1968-72: ""Golden Age"":

The band spent the first few months of 1968 working on material for their next album. Those sessions resulted in the song ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"", released as a single in May. The song and the subsequent album, Beggars Banquet (UK number 3; US 5), an eclectic mix of country and blues-inspired tunes, marked the band's return to their roots, and the beginning of their collaboration with producer Jimmy Miller. It featured the lead single ""Street Fighting Man"" (which addressed the political upheavals of May 1968) and ""Sympathy for the Devil"". 
Beggars Banquet was well received at the time of release. Richards said, ""There is a change between material on Satanic Majesties and Beggars Banquet. I'd grown sick to death of the whole Maharishi guru shit and the beads and bells. Who knows where these things come from, but I guess the music was a reaction to what we'd done in our time off and also that severe dose of reality. A spell in prison ... will certainly give you room for thought ... I was fucking pissed with being busted. So it was, 'Right we'll go and strip this thing down.' There's a lot of anger in the music from that period."" Richards started using open tunings for rhythm parts (often in conjunction with a capo), most prominently an open-E or open-D tuning in 1968. Beginning in 1969, he often used 5-string open-G tuning (with the lower 6th string removed), as heard on the 1969 single ""Honky Tonk Women"", ""Brown Sugar"" (Sticky Fingers, 1971), ""Tumbling Dice"" (capo IV), ""Happy"" (capo IV) (Exile on Main St., 1972), and ""Start Me Up"" (Tattoo You, 1981). 
The end of 1968 saw the filming of The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus. It featured John Lennon, Yoko Ono, The Dirty Mac, The Who, Jethro Tull, Marianne Faithfull, and Taj Mahal. The footage was shelved for twenty-eight years but was finally released officially in 1996, with a DVD version released in October 2004. 
By the release of Beggars Banquet, Brian Jones was increasingly troubled and was only sporadically contributing to the band. Jagger said that Jones was ""not psychologically suited to this way of life"". His drug use had become a hindrance, and he was unable to obtain a US visa. Richards reported that, in a June meeting with Jagger, Richards, and Watts at Jones' house, Jones admitted that he was unable to ""go on the road again"". Richards said all agreed to let Jones ""... say 'I've left, and if I want to I can come back'"". On 3 July 1969, less than a month later, Jones drowned in the swimming pool under mysterious circumstances at his home, Cotchford Farm, in Hartfield, East Sussex. 

The Rolling Stones were scheduled to play at a free concert for Blackhill Enterprises in London's Hyde Park, two days after Brian Jones' death; they decided to proceed with the show as a tribute to Jones. The concert, their first with Mick Taylor, was performed in front of an estimated 250,000 fans. The performance was filmed by a Granada Television production team, and was shown on British television as The Stones in the Park. Jagger read an excerpt from Shelley's poem Adonaïs, an elegy written on the death of his friend John Keats, and they released thousands of butterflies in memory of Jones before opening their set with ""I'm Yours and I'm Hers"", a Johnny Winter number. 
Also performed, but previously unheard by the audience, were ""Midnight Rambler"" and ""Love In Vain"" from their forthcoming album Let It Bleed (released December 1969) and ""Give Me A Drink"" which eventually appeared on Exile On Main Street (released May 1972). The show also included the concert debut of ""Honky Tonk Women"", which the band had just released the previous day. The Blackhill Enterprises stage manager Sam Cutler introduced them as ""the greatest rock & roll band in the world"", a description he repeated throughout their 1969 US tour, and which has stuck to this day (Cutler left Blackhill Enterprises to become the Stones' road manager following the Hyde Park concert). 
The release of Let It Bleed (UK number 1; US 3) came in December. Their last album of the sixties, Let It Bleed featured ""Gimme Shelter"". The lead female vocalist - and famed solo - on ""Gimme Shelter"" is performed by singer Merry Clayton, (sister of Sam Clayton, of the American rock band, Little Feat). 
Other tracks include ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" (with accompaniment by the London Bach Choir, who initially asked for their name to be removed from the album's credits after being apparently 'horrified' by the content of some of its other material, but later withdrew this request), ""Midnight Rambler"" as well as a cover of Robert Johnson's ""Love in Vain"". Jones and Taylor are featured on two tracks each. 
Just after the tour the band performed at the Altamont Free Concert at the Altamont Speedway, about 50 miles east of San Francisco. The biker gang Hells Angels provided security, and a fan, Meredith Hunter, was stabbed and beaten to death by the Angels after they realised that he was armed. Part of the tour and the Altamont concert were documented in Albert and David Maysles' film Gimme Shelter. As a response to the growing popularity of bootleg recordings (in particular the still sought-after Live'r Than You'll Ever Be), the album Get Yer Ya-Yas Out! (UK 1; US 6) was released in 1970; it was declared by critic Lester Bangs to be the best live album ever. 
At the turn of the decade the band appeared on the BBC's highly rated review of the sixties music scene Pop Go The Sixties, performing ""Gimme Shelter"" on the show, which was broadcast live on 31 December 1969. In 1970 the band's contracts with both Allen Klein and Decca Records ended (cf. ""Schoolboy Blues""), and amid contractual disputes with Klein, they formed their own record company, Rolling Stones Records. Sticky Fingers (UK number 1; US 1), released in March 1971, the band's first album on their own label, featured an elaborate cover design by Andy Warhol. The Stones' Decca catalogue is currently owned by Klein's ABKCO label. 

Sticky Fingers was the first to feature the logo of Rolling Stones Records, which effectively became the band's logo. It consisted of a pair of lips with a lapping tongue. Critic Sean Egan has said of the logo, ""Without using the Stones' name, it instantly conjures them, or at least Jagger, as well as a certain lasciviousness that is the Stones' own ... It quickly and deservedly became the most famous logo in the history of popular music."" The tongue and lips design was part of a package that, in 2003, VH1 named the ""No. 1 Greatest Album Cover"" of all time. 
The album contains one of their best known hits, ""Brown Sugar"", and the country-influenced ""Dead Flowers"". Both were recorded at Alabama's Muscle Shoals Sound Studio during the 1969 American tour. The album continued the band's immersion into heavily blues-influenced compositions. The album is noted for its ""loose, ramshackle ambience"" and marked Mick Taylor's first full release with the band. 
Following the release of Sticky Fingers, the Rolling Stones left England after receiving financial advice. They moved to the South of France, where Richards rented the Villa Nellcôte and sublet rooms to band members and entourage. Using the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio, they held recording sessions in the basement; they completed the resulting tracks, along with material dating as far back as 1969, at Sunset Studios in Los Angeles. The resulting double album, Exile on Main St. (UK number 1; US 1), was released in May 1972. Given an A+ grade by critic Robert Christgau and disparaged by Lester Bangs - who reversed his opinion within months - Exile is now accepted as one of the Stones' best albums. The films Cocksucker Blues (never officially released) and Ladies and Gentlemen: The Rolling Stones (released in 1974) document the subsequent highly publicised 1972 North American (""STP"") Tour. 
The band's double compilation, Hot Rocks 1964-1971, was released in 1972. The compilation is certified Diamond in the US having sold over 12 million copies, and has spent over 250 weeks on the Billboard album chart. 

1973-77: Mid seventies:
In November 1972, the band began sessions in Kingston, Jamaica, for their follow-up to Exile, Goats Head Soup (UK 1; US 1) (1973). The album spawned the worldwide hit ""Angie"", but proved the first in a string of commercially successful but tepidly received studio albums. The sessions for Goats Head Soup led to a number of outtakes, most notably an early version of the popular ballad ""Waiting on a Friend"", not released until Tattoo You eight years later. 

The making of the record was interrupted by another legal battle over drugs, dating back to their stay in France; a warrant for Richards' arrest had been issued, and the other band members had to return briefly to France for questioning. This, along with Jagger's convictions on drug charges (in 1967 and 1970), complicated the band's plans for their Pacific tour in early 1973: they were denied permission to play in Japan and almost banned from Australia. This was followed by a European tour (bypassing France) in September/October 1973 - prior to which Richards had been arrested once more on drug charges, this time in England. 
The band went to Musicland studios in Munich to record their next album, 1974's It's Only Rock 'n' Roll (UK 2; US 1), but Jimmy Miller, who had drug abuse issues, was no longer producer. Instead, Jagger and Richards assumed production duties and were credited as ""the Glimmer Twins"". Both the album and the single of the same name were hits. 
Near the end of 1974, Taylor began to lose patience. The band's situation made normal functioning complicated, with band members living in different countries and legal barriers restricting where they could tour. In addition, drug use was affecting Richards' creativity and productivity, and Taylor felt some of his own creative contributions were going unrecognised. At the end of 1974, with a recording session already booked in Munich to record another album, Taylor quit the Rolling Stones. 
Taylor said in 1980, ""I was getting a bit fed up. I wanted to broaden my scope as a guitarist and do something else ... I wasn't really composing songs or writing at that time. I was just beginning to write, and that influenced my decision ... There are some people who can just ride along from crest to crest; they can ride along somebody else's success. And there are some people for whom that's not enough. It really wasn't enough for me."" 

The Rolling Stones needed to find a replacement for Taylor and the recording sessions for the next album, Black and Blue (UK 2; US 1) (1976) in Munich provided an opportunity for some hopefuls to work while trying out for the band. Guitarists as stylistically disparate as Peter Frampton (Humble Pie's lead guitarist) and Jeff Beck (ex-Yardbirds virtuoso) were auditioned as well as Shuggie Otis. Both Beck and Irish blues rock guitarist Rory Gallagher later claimed that they had played without realising they were being auditioned, and both agreed that they would never have joined. American session players Wayne Perkins and Harvey Mandel also worked on much of the album but Richards and Jagger had a preference for the band to remain purely British. When Ronnie Wood auditioned, everyone agreed that he was the right choice. 
Wood had already recorded and played live with Richards, and had contributed to the recording and writing of the track ""It's Only Rock 'n Roll"". He had earlier declined Jagger's offer to join the Stones, because of his ties to The Faces, saying ""that's what's really important to me"".Rod Stewart went so far as to say he would take bets that Ronnie would not join the Stones. 
Wood committed to the Rolling Stones in 1975 for their upcoming Tour of the Americas. He officially joined the band the following year, as the Faces dissolved. Unlike the other band members, however, Wood was a salaried employee and remained so until Wyman's departure nearly two decades later, when Wood finally became a full member of the Rolling Stones' partnership. 
The 1975 Tour of the Americas kicked off in New York City with the band performing on a flatbed trailer being pulled down Broadway. The tour featured stage props including a giant phallus and a rope on which Jagger swung out over the audience. Jagger had booked live recording sessions at the El Mocambo club in Toronto to balance a long-overdue live album, 1977's Love You Live (UK 3; US 5), the first Stones live album since 1970's Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out! The Rolling Stones in Concert. 

Richards' addiction to heroin delayed his arrival in Toronto; the other members had already assembled, awaiting Richards, and sent him a telegram asking him where he was. On 24 February 1977, when Richards and his family flew in from London, they were temporarily detained by Canada Customs after Richards was found in possession of a burnt spoon and hash residue. Three days later, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, armed with an arrest warrant for Pallenberg, discovered ""22 grams of heroin"" in Richards' room. Richards was charged with importing narcotics into Canada, an offence that carried a minimum seven-year sentence. 
Later the Crown prosecutor conceded that Richards had procured the drugs after arrival. Despite the arrest, the band played two shows in Toronto, only to raise more controversy when Margaret Trudeau, then-wife of Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, was seen partying with the band after one show. The band's two shows were not advertised to the public. Instead, the El Mocambo had been booked for the entire week by April Wine for a recording session. 1050 CHUM, a local radio station, ran a contest for free tickets to see April Wine. Contest winners who selected tickets for Friday or Saturday night were surprised to find the Rolling Stones playing. 
On 4 March, Richards' partner Anita Pallenberg pleaded guilty to drug possession and incurred a fine in connection with the original airport incident. The drug case against Richards dragged on for over a year. Ultimately, Richards received a suspended sentence and was ordered to play two free concerts for the CNIB in Oshawa; both shows featured the Rolling Stones and the New Barbarians, a group that Wood had put together to promote his latest solo album, and which Richards also joined. This episode strengthened Richards' resolve to stop using heroin. 
It also contributed to the end of his relationship with Pallenberg, which had become strained since the death of their third child (an infant son named Tara). In addition, Pallenberg was unable to curb her heroin addiction while Keith struggled to get clean. While Richards was settling his legal and personal problems, Jagger continued his jet-set lifestyle. He was a regular at New York's Studio 54 disco club, often in the company of model Jerry Hall. His marriage to Bianca Jagger ended in 1977, although they had long been estranged. 
Although the Rolling Stones remained popular through the first half of the 1970s, music critics had grown increasingly dismissive of the band's output, and record sales failed to meet expectations. By the late 1970s, after punk rock became influential, many criticised the Rolling Stones as decadent, ageing millionaires and their music as stagnant or irrelevant. 

1978-82: Commercial peak:
This changed in 1978, after the band released Some Girls (UK No. 2; US No. 1), which included the hit single ""Miss You"", the country ballad ""Far Away Eyes"", ""Beast of Burden"", and ""Shattered"". In part as a response to punk, many songs, particularly ""Respectable"", were fast, basic, guitar-driven rock and roll, and the album's success re-established the Rolling Stones' immense popularity among young people. Following the US Tour 1978, the band guested on the first show of the fourth season of the TV series Saturday Night Live. The group did not tour Europe the following year, breaking the routine of touring Europe every three years that the band had followed since 1967. 
Following the success of Some Girls, the band released their next album Emotional Rescue (UK 1; US 1) in mid-1980. The recording of the album was reportedly plagued by turmoil, with Jagger and Richards' relationship reaching a new low. Richards, though still using heroin according to former keyboardist of The Small Faces Ian McLagan, wanted to tour in summer or autumn of 1980 to promote the new album, which Jagger declined.Emotional Rescue hit the top of the charts on both sides of the Atlantic and the title track reached No.3 in the US. 

In early 1981, the group reconvened and decided to tour the US that year, leaving little time to write and record a new album, as well as rehearse for the tour. That year's resulting album, Tattoo You (UK 2; US 1), featured a number of outtakes, including lead single ""Start Me Up"", which reached No.2 in the US and ranked No.22 on Billboard's Hot 100 year-end chart. Two songs (""Waiting on a Friend"" (US No. 13) and ""Tops"") featured Mick Taylor's guitar playing, while jazz saxophonist Sonny Rollins played on ""Slave"" and dubbed a part on ""Waiting on a Friend"". 
The Rolling Stones scored one more top 20 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1982, the No.20 hit ""Hang Fire"". The Stones' American Tour 1981 was their biggest, longest and most colourful production to date, with the band playing from 25 September through 19 December. It was the highest grossing tour of that year. 
Some shows were recorded, resulting in the 1982 live album Still Life (American Concert 1981) (UK 4; US 5), and the 1983 Hal Ashby concert film Let's Spend the Night Together, which was filmed at Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Arizona and the Brendan Byrne Arena in the Meadowlands, New Jersey. Also in 1981, they played a concert at Chicago's Checkerboard Lounge with Muddy Waters, in what would be one of his last public appearances before his death in 1983. 
In mid-1982, to commemorate their 20th anniversary, the Rolling Stones took their American stage show to Europe. The European Tour 1982 was their first European tour in six years. The tour was similar to their 1981 American tour. For the tour, the band were joined by former Allman Brothers Band pianist, Chuck Leavell, who continues to perform and record with the Rolling Stones to date. By the end of the year, the band had signed a new four-album recording deal with a new label, CBS Records, for a reported $50 million, then the biggest record deal in history. 

1983-88: Band turmoil, solo efforts, and decline:
Before leaving Atlantic, the Rolling Stones released Undercover (UK 3; US 4) in late 1983. Despite good reviews and the Top Ten peak position of the title track, the record sold below expectations and there was no tour to support it. Subsequently the Stones' new marketer/distributor CBS Records took over distributing the Stones' Atlantic catalogue. 

By this time, the Jagger/Richards split was growing. Much to the consternation of Richards, Jagger had signed a solo deal with CBS Records, and he spent much of 1984 writing songs for this first solo effort. He has also stated that he was feeling stultified within the framework of the Rolling Stones. By 1985, Jagger was spending more time on solo recordings, and much of the material on 1986's Dirty Work (UK No. 4; US No. 4) was generated by Keith Richards, with more contributions by Ronnie Wood than on previous Rolling Stones albums. The album was recorded in Paris, and Jagger was often absent from the studio, leaving Richards to keep the recording sessions moving forward. 
In June 1985, Jagger teamed up with rock musician David Bowie in the music video ""Dancing in the Street"", which was recorded as part of the Live Aid charity movement. This was one of Jagger's first solo performances, and the song reached No 1 in the UK, and No 7 in the US. In December 1985, the band's co-founder, pianist, road manager and long-time friend Ian Stewart died of a heart attack. The Rolling Stones played a private tribute concert for him at London's 100 Club in February 1986, two days before they were presented with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. 
Dirty Work was released in March 1986 to mixed reviews despite the presence of the US Top Five hit ""Harlem Shuffle"". With relations between Richards and Jagger at an all-time low, Jagger refused to tour to promote the album, and instead undertook his own solo tour which included Rolling Stones songs. Richards has referred to this period in his relations with Jagger as ""World War III"". As a result of animosity within the band during this period, they almost broke up. Jagger's solo records, She's The Boss (UK 6; US 13) (1985) and Primitive Cool (UK 26; US 41) (1987), met with moderate success, and in 1988, with the Rolling Stones inactive, Richards released his first solo album, Talk Is Cheap (UK 37; US 24). It was well received by fans and critics, going gold in the US. 

1989-99: Comeback, return to popularity, and record-breaking tours:
In early 1989, the Rolling Stones, including Mick Taylor and Ronnie Wood as well as Brian Jones and Ian Stewart (posthumously), were inducted into the American Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Jagger and Richards set aside animosities and went to work on a new Rolling Stones album that would be called Steel Wheels (UK 2; US 3). Heralded as a return to form, it included the singles ""Mixed Emotions"" (US No. 5), ""Rock and a Hard Place"" (US No. 23) and ""Almost Hear You Sigh"". The album also included ""Continental Drift"", which the Rolling Stones recorded in Tangier, Morocco in 1989 with The Master Musicians of Jajouka led by Bachir Attar, coordinated by Tony King and Cherie Nutting. A BBC documentary film, The Rolling Stones in Morocco, was produced by Nigel Finch. 
The subsequent Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle Tours, encompassing North America, Japan, and Europe, saw the Rolling Stones touring for the first time in seven years (since Europe 1982), and it was their biggest stage production to date. Opening acts included Living Colour and Guns N' Roses; the onstage personnel included a horn section and backup singers Lisa Fischer and Bernard Fowler, both of whom continue to tour regularly with the Rolling Stones. Recordings from the Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle tours produced the 1991 concert album Flashpoint (UK 6; US 16), which also included two studio tracks recorded in 1991: the single ""Highwire"" and ""Sex Drive"". The tour produced the IMAX concert film Live at the Max released in 1991. 
These were the last Rolling Stones tours for Bill Wyman, who left the band after years of deliberation, although his retirement was not made official until January 1993. He then published Stone Alone, an autobiography based on scrapbooks and diaries he had been keeping since the band's early days. A few years later he formed Bill Wyman's Rhythm Kings and began recording and touring again. 
After the successes of the Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle tours, the band took a break. Charlie Watts released two jazz albums; Ronnie Wood recorded his fifth solo album, the first in 11 years, called Slide On This; Bill Wyman released his fourth solo album; Keith Richards released his second solo album in late 1992, Main Offender, and did a small tour including big concerts in Spain and Argentina. Mick Jagger got good reviews and sales with his third solo album, Wandering Spirit (UK 12; US 11). The album sold more than two million copies worldwide, going gold in the US. 

After Wyman's departure, the Rolling Stones' new distributor/record label, Virgin Records, remastered and repackaged the band's back catalogue from Sticky Fingers to Steel Wheels, except for the three live albums, and issued another hits compilation in 1993 entitled Jump Back. By 1993 the Rolling Stones set upon their next studio album. Darryl Jones, former sideman of Miles Davis and Sting, was chosen by Charlie Watts as Wyman's replacement for 1994's Voodoo Lounge (UK 1; US 2). The album met strong reviews and sales, going double platinum in the US. Reviewers took note of the album's ""traditionalist"" sounds, which were credited to the Rolling Stones' new producer Don Was.Voodoo Lounge would win the Stones the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album at the 1995 Grammy Awards. 
1994 also brought the accompanying Voodoo Lounge Tour, which lasted into 1995. The tour grossed $320 million, becoming the world's highest grossing tour at the time. Numbers from various concerts and rehearsals (mostly acoustic) made up Stripped (UK 9; US 9), which featured a cover of Bob Dylan's ""Like a Rolling Stone"", as well as infrequently played songs like ""Shine a Light"", ""Sweet Virginia"" and ""The Spider and the Fly"". On 8 September 1994, the Rolling Stones performed their new song ""Love Is Strong"" as well as ""Start Me Up"" at the 1994 MTV Video Music Awards at Radio City Music Hall in New York. The band received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the ceremony. 
The Rolling Stones were the first major recording artists to broadcast a concert over the Internet; a 20-minute video was broadcast on 18 November 1994 using the Mbone at 10 frames per second. The broadcast, engineered by Thinking Pictures and financed by Sun Microsystems, was one of the first demonstrations of streaming video; while it was not a true webcast, it introduced many to the technology. 

The Rolling Stones ended the 1990s with the album Bridges to Babylon (UK 6; US 3), released in 1997 to mixed reviews. The video of the single ""Anybody Seen My Baby?"" featured Angelina Jolie as guest and met steady rotation on both MTV and VH1. Sales were reasonably equivalent to those of previous records (about 1.2 million copies sold in the US), and the subsequent Bridges to Babylon Tour, which crossed Europe, North America and other destinations, proved the band to be a strong live attraction. Once again, a live album was culled from the tour, No Security (UK 67; US 34), only this time all but two songs (""Live With Me"" and ""The Last Time"") were previously unreleased on live albums. In 1999, the Rolling Stones staged the No Security Tour in the US and continued the Bridges to Babylon tour in Europe. 

2000-11: A Bigger Bang and continued success:
In late 2001, Mick Jagger released his fourth solo album, Goddess in the Doorway (UK 44; US 39) which met with mixed reviews. A month after the September 11 attacks, Jagger and Richards took part in ""The Concert for New York City"", performing ""Salt of the Earth"" and ""Miss You"" with a backing band. 
In 2002, the band released Forty Licks (UK 2; US 2), a greatest hits double album, to mark their forty years as a band. The collection contained four new songs recorded with the latter-day core band of Jagger, Richards, Watts, Wood, Leavell and Jones. The album has sold more than 7 million copies worldwide. The same year, Q magazine named the Rolling Stones as one of the ""50 Bands To See Before You Die"", and the 2002-2003 Licks Tour gave people that chance. The tour included shows in small theatres. The band headlined the Molson Canadian Rocks for Toronto concert in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, to help the city - which they have used for rehearsals since the Steel Wheels tour - recover from the 2003 SARS epidemic. The concert was attended by an estimated 490,000 people. 
On 9 November 2003, the band played their first concert in Hong Kong as part of the Harbour Fest celebration, also in support of the SARS-affected economy. In November 2003, the band exclusively licensed the right to sell their new four-DVD boxed set, Four Flicks, recorded on the band's most recent world tour, to the US Best Buy chain of stores. In response, some Canadian and US music retail chains (including HMV Canada and Circuit City) pulled Rolling Stones CDs and related merchandise from their shelves and replaced them with signs explaining the situation. In 2004, a double live album of the Licks Tour, Live Licks (UK 38; US 50), was released, going gold in the US. In November 2004, the Rolling Stones were among the inaugural inductees into the UK Music Hall of Fame. 

On 26 July 2005, Jagger's birthday, the band announced the name of their new album, A Bigger Bang (UK 2; US 3), their first album in almost eight years. A Bigger Bang was released on 6 September to strong reviews, including a glowing write-up in Rolling Stone magazine. The single ""Streets of Love"" reached the top 15 in the UK. 
The album included the political ""Sweet Neo Con"", a criticism of American Neoconservatism from Jagger. The song was reportedly almost dropped from the album because of objections from Richards. When asked if he was afraid of political backlash such as the Dixie Chicks had endured, Richards responded that the album came first, and that, ""I don't want to be sidetracked by some little political 'storm in a teacup'."" 
The subsequent A Bigger Bang Tour began in August 2005, and visited North America, South America and East Asia. In February 2006, the group played the half-time show of Super Bowl XL in Detroit, Michigan. By the end of 2005, the Bigger Bang tour set a record of $162 million in gross receipts, breaking the North American mark also set by the Rolling Stones 1994. On 18 February 2006 the band played a free concert to over one million people at the Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro; one of the biggest rock concerts of all time. 

After performances in Japan, China, Australia and New Zealand in March/April 2006, the Rolling Stones tour took a scheduled break before proceeding to Europe; during this break Keith Richards was hospitalised in New Zealand for cranial surgery after a fall from a tree on Fiji, where he had been on holiday. The incident led to a six-week delay in launching the European leg of the tour. In June 2006 it was reported that Ronnie Wood was continuing his programme of rehabilitation for alcohol abuse, but this did not affect the rearranged European tour schedule. Two out of the 21 shows scheduled for July-September 2006 were later cancelled due to Mick Jagger's throat problems. 
The Rolling Stones returned to North America for concerts in September 2006, and returned to Europe on 5 June 2007. By November 2006, the Bigger Bang tour had been declared the highest grossing tour of all time. 
The Rolling Stones performances at New York City's Beacon Theatre on 29 October and 1 November 2006 were filmed by Martin Scorsese for a documentary film, Shine a Light, which was released in 2008. The film also features guest appearances by Buddy Guy, Jack White, and Christina Aguilera. An accompanying soundtrack, also titled Shine a Light (UK 2; US 11), was released in April 2008. The album's debut at number 2 in the UK charts was the highest position for a Rolling Stones concert album since Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out! The Rolling Stones in Concert in 1970. At the Beacon Theater show, Music Executive, Ahmet Ertegun fell and ultimately succumbed to his injury. 
On 24 March 2007, the band announced a tour of Europe called the ""Bigger Bang 2007"" tour. 12 June 2007 saw the release of the band's second four-disc DVD set: The Biggest Bang, a seven-hour document featuring their shows in Austin, Rio de Janeiro, Saitama, Shanghai and Buenos Aires, along with extras. On 10 June 2007, the band performed their first gig at a festival in 30 years, at the Isle of Wight Festival, to a crowd of 65,000, and were joined onstage by Amy Winehouse. On 26 August 2007, they played their last concert of the Bigger Bang tour at The O2 Arena in London. At the conclusion of the tour, the band had grossed a record setting $558 million and were listed in the latest edition of Guinness World Records. 
Mick Jagger released a compilation of his solo work called The Very Best of Mick Jagger (UK 57; US 77), including three unreleased songs, on 2 October 2007. On 12 November 2007, ABKCO released Rolled Gold: The Very Best of the Rolling Stones, a double-CD remake of the 1975 compilation Rolled Gold. 

In a 2007 interview with Mick Jagger after nearly two years of touring, Jagger refused to say when the band is going to retire: ""I'm sure the Rolling Stones will do more things, more records and more tours, we've got no plans to stop any of that, really. As far as I'm concerned, I'm sure we'll continue."" In March 2008 Keith Richards sparked rumours that a new Rolling Stones studio album may be forthcoming, saying during an interview following the premiere of Shine a Light, ""I think we might make another album. Once we get over doing promotion on this film"". Drummer Charlie Watts remarked that he got ill whenever he stopped working. 
In July 2008 it was announced that the Rolling Stones were leaving EMI and signing with Vivendi's Universal Music, taking with them their catalogue stretching back to Sticky Fingers. New music released by the band while under this contract will be issued through Universal's Polydor label.Mercury Records will hold the US rights to the pre-1994 material, while the post-1994 material will be handled by Interscope Records (once a subsidiary of Atlantic). 
During the autumn, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards worked with producer Don Was to add new vocals and guitar parts to ten unfinished songs from the Exile on Main St. sessions. Jagger and Mick Taylor also did a session together in London where Taylor added lead guitar to what would be the expanded album's single, ""Plundered My Soul"". On 17 April 2010, the band released a limited edition 7-inch vinyl single of the previously unreleased track ""Plundered My Soul"" in honour of Record Store Day. The track, part of the group's 2010 re-issue of Exile on Main St., was combined with ""All Down the Line"" as its B-side. The band appeared at Cannes Festival for the premiere of the documentary Stones in Exile (directed by Stephen Kijak) about the recording of the album Exile on Main St.. On 23 May, the re-issue of Exile on Main St. reached No. 1 in the UK charts, almost 38 years to the week after it first occupied that position, with the band becoming the first act ever to see a classic work return to No. 1 decades after it was first released. In the US, the album re-entered the charts at No. 2. 
On 11 October 2010, the Stones released Ladies and Gentlemen: The Rolling Stones to the cinemas and later on to DVD. A digitally remastered version of the film was shown in select cinemas across the United States. This live performance was recorded during 4 shows in Ft. Worth and Houston, Texas in support of their The Rolling Stones American Tour 1972 and their album Exile on Main St.. The film was released to cinemas in 1974 but until now it was never available for home release apart from the numerous bootleg copies. 
On 4 October 2011, the Stones released The Rolling Stones: Some Girls Live In Texas '78 to the cinemas and later on to DVD. A digitally remastered version of the film was shown in select cinemas across the US. This live performance was recorded during one show in Ft. Worth, Texas in support of their US Tour 1978 and their album Some Girls. The film was released in (DVD/Blu-ray Disc) on 15 November 2011. On 21 November, the Stones reissued their 1978 album Some Girls as a 2 CD deluxe edition with a second CD of twelve previously unreleased tracks (except ""So Young,"" which was a b-side to ""Out of Tears"") from the sessions for Some Girls, like the 2010 reissue of Exile On Main St., with mostly newly recorded vocals from Jagger. 

2012-present: 50th anniversary:

The Rolling Stones celebrated their 50th anniversary in the summer of 2012 by releasing a large hardback book titled 50. A new take on the band's lip-and-tongue logo, designed by Shepard Fairey, was also released and used during the celebrations. 
The documentary titled Crossfire Hurricane, directed by Brett Morgen, was released in October 2012. Approximately fifty hours of interviews were conducted by Morgen for use for the documentary, including interviews with Bill Wyman and Mick Taylor, which Morgen says are ""the most extensive group interviews they've ever done."" This would be the first official career-spanning documentary since 1989's 25x5: The Continuing Adventures of the Rolling Stones, which was filmed for their 25th anniversary in 1988. 
A new compilation album, GRRR!, was released on 12 November, available in four different formats and including two new tracks, ""Doom and Gloom"" and ""One More Shot"", which were recorded at Studio Guillaume Tell in Paris, France, within the last few weeks of August 2012. The album debuted at No. 3 in the UK and No. 19 in the US. The music video for ""Doom and Gloom"" featuring Noomi Rapace was released on 20 November. 

On 25 November 2012, the Stones commenced their 50 & Counting... tour at London's O2 Arena, where they were joined by Jeff Beck. At their second show in London on 29 November the group were joined onstage by Eric Clapton and Florence Welch. Their third anniversary concert took place on 8 December at the Barclays Center, Brooklyn, New York. The last two dates were at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey on 13 and 15 December, and the band were joined by Bruce Springsteen and blues rock band The Black Keys on the final night. They also played two songs at 12-12-12: The Concert for Sandy Relief. 
The Stones played nineteen shows in the US in spring 2013, before playing three shows in England, one at Glastonbury Festival 2013 and two in Hyde Park, London. On Richard Bacon's BBC Radio 5 Live show on 3 April 2013 it was announced that the Stones would hold a concert in Hyde Park as part of their 50th anniversary celebrations, although unlike their 1969 performance in the park it would not be free, tickets being £95 each. Jagger quipped, ""I'll try and keep the poetry to a minimum,"" and remarked, in respect of the white dress that he wore for the 1969 concert, ""I can still just about get into the zippers."" Richards announced 9 April 2013 on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon that Mick Taylor would be performing with the band for shows on the 50 & Counting... tour. The Rolling Stones made their Glastonbury debut, headlining on Saturday 29 June 2013.Hyde Park Live, a live album recorded at Hyde Park on 6 and 13 July 2013, was released exclusively as a digital download through iTunes on 22 July 2013 and peaked at No. 16 in the UK and No. 19 in the US. A live DVD, Sweet Summer Sun: Live in Hyde Park, was released on 11 November 2013. 
In February 2014, the band embarked on the ""14 On Fire"" tour spanning Middle East, Asia, Australia and Europe due to last until Summer 2014. On 17 March 2014, the sudden death in New York City of L'Wren Scott, the longtime girlfriend/partner of Jagger, was reported by various news sources as the Rolling Stones were in Australia preparing for their first show in Perth. It was announced on their website that those shows were cancelled for that reason, and would be rescheduled at a later date. On 15 April 2014, the band announced that they had rescheduled their Australian tour to start at the newly revamped Adelaide Oval on 25 October. 
On 4 June 2014, the Rolling Stones performed for the first time in Israel with the Haaretz newspaper going as far as describing the concert as being ""Historic with a capital H"". 

Musical development:
The Rolling Stones are notable in modern popular music for assimilating various musical genres into their own collective sound. Throughout the band's career, their musical contributions have been marked by a continual reference and reliance on musical styles including blues, rhythm and blues, country, folk, reggae, dance, and world music, exemplified by Jones' collaboration with the Master Musicians of Jajouka, as well as traditional English styles that use stringed instrumentation like harps. Brian Jones experimented with the use of non-traditional instruments such as the sitar and slide guitar in their early days. The group started out covering early rock 'n' roll and blues songs, and have never stopped playing live or recording cover songs. 

Infusion of American blues:
Jagger and Richards shared an admiration of Jimmy Reed, Muddy Waters, and Little Walter, and their interest influenced Brian Jones, of whom Richards says, ""He was more into T-Bone Walker and jazz blues stuff. We'd turn him onto Chuck Berry and say, 'Look, it's all the same shit, man, and you can do it.'"" Charlie Watts, a traditional jazz drummer, was also introduced to the blues through his association with the pair. ""Keith and Brian turned me on to Jimmy Reed and people like that. I learned that Earl Phillips was playing on those records like a jazz drummer, playing swing, with a straight four."" 
Jagger, recalling when he first heard the likes of Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Muddy Waters, Fats Domino, and other major American R&B artists, said it ""seemed the most real thing"" he had heard up to that point. Similarly, Keith Richards, describing the first time he listened to Muddy Waters, said it was the ""most powerful music he had ever heard ... the most expressive."" He also stated, ""when you think of some dopey, spotty seventeen year old from Dartford, who wants to be Muddy Waters-- and there were a lot of us-- in a way, very pathetic, but in another way, very ... heartwarming"". 

Early songwriting:
Despite the Rolling Stones' predilection for blues and R&B numbers on their early live setlists, the first original compositions by the band reflected a more wide-ranging interest. The first Jagger/Richards single, ""Tell Me (You're Coming Back)"", has been described by critic Richie Unterberger as a ""pop rock ballad ... When Jagger and Richards began to write songs, they were usually not derived from the blues, but were often surprisingly fey, slow, Mersey-type pop numbers"". ""As Tears Go By"", the ballad originally written for Marianne Faithfull, was one of the first songs written by Jagger and Richards and also one of many written by the duo for other artists. Jagger said of the song, ""It's a relatively mature song considering the rest of the output at the time. And we didn't think of recording it, because The Rolling Stones were a butch blues group."" The Rolling Stones did later record a version which became a top five hit in the US. 
On the early experience, Richards said, ""The amazing thing is that although Mick and I thought these songs were really puerile and kindergarten-time, every one that got put out made a decent showing in the charts. That gave us extraordinary confidence to carry on, because at the beginning songwriting was something we were going to do in order to say to Andrew Loog Oldham, 'Well, at least we gave it a try ...'"" Jagger said, ""We were very pop-orientated. We didn't sit around listening to Muddy Waters; we listened to everything. In some ways it's easy to write to order ... Keith and I got into the groove of writing those kind of tunes; they were done in ten minutes. I think we thought it was a bit of a laugh, and it turned out to be something of an apprenticeship for us."" 
The writing of ""The Last Time"", the Rolling Stones' first major single, proved a turning point. Richards called it ""a bridge into thinking about writing for the Stones. It gave us a level of confidence; a pathway of how to do it."" The song was based on a traditional gospel song popularised by the Staple Singers, but the Rolling Stones' number features a distinctive guitar riff, played by Brian Jones. Prior to the emergence of Jagger/Richards as the Stones' songwriters, the band members occasionally were given collective credit under the pseudonym Nanker Phelge. Some songs attributed to Nanker Phelge have been re-attributed to Jagger/Richards.

History and origin:
The band's moniker is a reference to a character in the 1974 film Dark Star (played by Dan O'Bannon, who also co-wrote the film), directed by John Carpenter. Audio samples from this film are used frequently in the band's early works. 
In 2004, Pinback signed to Touch and Go Records. They released their third album, Summer in Abaddon, later that year. Pinback's fourth full-length album, Autumn of the Seraphs, was released on September 11, 2007. The band also recently released a collection of rarities, entitled Nautical Antiques. They appeared live in a nationally broadcast interview and played a couple of songs on NPR's Talk of the Nation on October 8, 2007. The program is available for download via NPR's website. 
On April 1, 2009, it was announced that Pinback was working on a new album that would be released by Temporary Residence Ltd. Their fifth studio album, Information Retrieved, was released October 16, 2012. On August 15, 2012, Pinback released the song ""Proceed to Memory"" from Information Retrieved free to play through RollingStone.com. 
On March 9, 2015 Rob Crow announced via social media that he would be leaving the music scence to focus on being a father. ""I'm fine. I have just come to the realization that making music in this climate is financially irresponsible to my family and ultimately humiliating to my psyche. Im going to finish and release the work I've already spent my heart and tears on, but even that is likely to ruin me. My kids are growing and my downstairs studio would probably be put to better use as a bedroom. I'll keep a small setup with which I can use for scoring, editing and things when they come up. Also quitting Facebook and Twitter and using that energy to concentrate on writing in my journal. Chucking the booze as well will help with that. I just trying to make a mature decision and be a responsible husband and father."" This putting Pinback on hiatus. Zach Smith says he is not going anywhere and will continue to make music as long as he can. 
Smith and Crow have been the band's two consistent members. They are typically joined by drummer Chris Prescott. Tom Zinser and Mario Rubalcaba have previously contributed drums. Other past members of the Pinback live band are: Erik Hoversten, Braden Diotte, Terrin Durfey, Ryan Bromley, Cameron Jones, Kenseth Thibideau, Brent Asbury, Tom Zinser, Gabriel Voiles, Dmitri Dziensuwski, Donny Van Zandt, and Thatcher Orbitashi.]",0.419201804064,0.580777,"[indie rock, lo-fi, slow core, indie pop, post rock, math rock]",0.56868,0.733847568598,0.813363663314,0.367243049654,0.478388524164,0.75787639502,7.0,0.115946008978,0.394847699287,1.0,0.0379013378161,0.749602614479,4.0,0.520831083577,0

It wasn't ..., Led Zeppelin was the definitive heavy metal band. It wasn't ..., Led Zeppelin were an English rock band originally formed in 1968 by guitarist Jimmy Page under the name ""The New Yardbirds"", based on Page's previous band, The Yardbirds. The band formed when Jimmy Page (guitar) recruited Robert Plant (vocals, harmonica), John Paul Jones (bass guitar, keyboards, mandolin), and John Bonham (drums). With their heavy, guitar-driven blues-rock sound, Led Zeppelin are regularly cited as one of the progenitors of heavy metal and hard rock music. However, the band's individualistic style drew from many sources and transcends any one genre. Led Zeppelin did not release songs from their albums as singles in the UK, as they preferred to develop the concept of ""album-oriented rock"".  Thirty years after disbanding following Bonham's death in 1980, the band continues to be held in high regard for their artistic achievements, commercial success, and broad influence. The band have sold over 200 million albums worldwide, including 111.5 million certified units in the United States, making them one of the best-selling music artists of all time. They have had all of their original studio albums reach the top ten of the Billboard album chart in the US, with six reaching the number one spot.  Shortly after their first tour, the group's eponymous first album was released on 12th January 1969. Its blend of blues and rock influences with distorted amplification made it one of the pivotal records in the evolution of heavy metal music. Although several of Led Zeppelin's earliest songs were based on or were cover versions of blues standards, others such as ""Communication Breakdown"" had a unique and distinctively heavy sound. Led Zeppelin also featured delicate acoustic guitar on ""Black Mountain Side"" in which the influence of Davy Graham can be heard, and a combination of acoustic and electric approaches on the reworked folk song ""Babe I'm Gonna Leave You"". The immediate success of the first album kick-started the band's career, especially in the United States, where they would frequently tour.   The second record, simply titled Led Zeppelin II, followed in similar style later that year, and was an even greater success for the group, reaching the number-one chart position in both the United States and the United Kingdom.  Jimmy Page and Robert Plant were blues fanatics; their first album included the Willie Dixon song ""You Shook Me"", and their later hit ""Whole Lotta Love"" was lyrically very similar to an earlier Dixon song. (The band were subsequently accused of using his lyrics without crediting Dixon, and it was not until Chess Records brought suit fifteen years later, that proper credit - and a monetary settlement - was given.)   The band also loved American rock and roll; the exuberant styles of Fats Domino and Little Richard were inspirations, and Led Zeppelin would perform rockabilly songs originally made famous by Elvis Presley and Eddie Cochran. Onstage, Led Zeppelin concerts could last more than three hours; expanded, improvised live versions of their song repertoire often incorporated tight workouts of James Brown, Stax, and Motown-influenced soul music and funk (favourites of bassist Jones and drummer Bonham).  For the writing of the music on their third album, Led Zeppelin III, the band retired to Bron-yr-Aur, a remote cottage in Wales. This resulted in a more acoustic sound (and a song ""Bron-yr-Aur Stomp"", misspellt as ""Bron-y-Aur Stomp"" on the album cover) strongly influenced by Celtic and folk music. Led Zeppelin III also ushered in an era of unique album jackets, this one featuring a wheel that displayed various images through cutouts in the main jacket sleeve when rotated. In November 1970 Led Zeppelin's record label, Atlantic Records, released ""Immigrant Song"" as a single against the band's wishes (Atlantic had earlier released an edited version of ""Whole Lotta Love"" which cut the 5:34 song to 3:10). It included their only B-side, ""Hey Hey What Can I Do"". Even though the band saw their albums as indivisible, whole listening experiences - and their manager, Peter Grant, maintained an aggressive pro-album stance - nine other singles were released without their consent. The group also resisted television appearances, which would have reduced their ability to control their presentation and sound quality. Lack of Zeppelin television exposure also enforced the band's preference that their fans hear and see them in person.  Their fourth album, Led Zeppelin IV was actually untitled, but is commonly referred to as Zoso, Runes, The Fourth Album, Sticks, Man with Sticks, or Four Symbols; it featured ""Stairway to Heaven"", which Jimmy Page performed on stage on a custom-built double-necked electric Gibson guitar, the top neck a twelve-stringed version.  Over twenty-five years after disbanding in response to drummer John Bonham's tragic death in 1980, Led Zeppelin continue to be held in high regard for their artistic achievements, commercial success and influence.  Since they disbanded, Page, Plant, and Jones have only played together on rare occasions. Page and Plant did get back together to record No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded as part of the MTV Unplugged series in 1994, which was accompanied by a worldwide tour, and again in 1998 for the studio album Walking Into Clarksdale. John Paul Jones also has performed since the break up - at the Bonnaroo music festival in Manchester, Tennessee. He was part of a ""SuperJam"" featuring himself on bass, Ben Harper on guitar, and Ahmir ""?uestlove"" Thompson on drums. He also played as a guest during the sets of various other artists throughout the weekend.   Most recently Led Zeppelin have reformed (with Jason Bonham filling in on drums) for a one-off reunion concert in memory of Atlantic Records co-founder and executive Ahmet Ertegün. After a postponement due to Jimmy Page fracturing one of his fingers, the group performed on 10th December 2007 at the O2 Arena, London. The concert was filmed for a potential DVD release.  Jimmy Page has hinted that the group may start work on new material, and that a world tour may be in the works.   Awards and accolades  Led Zeppelin were honoured by US President Barack Obama at the 2012 Kennedy Center Honors Throughout their career, Led Zeppelin have collected many honours and awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006. Among the band's awards are an American Music Award in 2005, and the Polar Music Prize in 2006. Led Zeppelin were the recipient of a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005, and four of their recordings have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. They have been awarded five Diamond albums, as well as fourteen Multi-Platinum, four Platinum and one Gold album in the United States, while in the UK they have five Multi-Platinum, six Platinum, one Gold and four Silver albums. In addition to listing five of their albums among The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, Rolling Stone named Led Zeppelin the 14th-greatest artist of all time in 2004.  Page was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in recognition of his charity work in 2005 and Plant was honoured as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his services to popular music in 2009. The band are ranked number one on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock and Classic Rock's ""50 best live acts of all time"". They were awarded an Ivor Novello Award for ""Outstanding Contribution to British Music"" in 1977, as well as a ""Lifetime Achievement Award"" at the 42nd Annual Ivor Novello awards ceremony in 1997. The band were honoured at the 2008 MOJO Awards with the ""Best Live Act"" prize for their one-off reunion, and were described as the ""greatest rock and roll band of all time"". The three surviving members (Page, Plant, and Jones) were named as 2012 recipients of Kennedy Center Honors.

The group consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. The band's heavy, guitar-driven sound, rooted in blues and psychedelia on their early albums, has earned them recognition as one of the progenitors of heavy metal, though their unique style drew from a wide variety of influences, including folk music. 
After changing their name from the New Yardbirds, Led Zeppelin signed a deal with Atlantic Records that afforded them considerable artistic freedom. Although the group was initially unpopular with critics, they achieved significant commercial success with albums such as Led Zeppelin (1969), Led Zeppelin II (1969), Led Zeppelin III (1970), their untitled fourth album (1971), Houses of the Holy (1973), and Physical Graffiti (1975). Their fourth album, which features the track ""Stairway to Heaven"", is among the most popular and influential works in rock music, and it helped to secure the group's popularity. 
Page wrote most of Led Zeppelin's music, particularly early in their career, while Plant generally supplied the lyrics. Jones' keyboard-based compositions later became central to the group's catalogue, which featured increasing experimentation. The latter half of their career saw a series of record-breaking tours that earned the group a reputation for excess and debauchery. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, their output and touring schedule were limited during the late 1970s, and the group disbanded following Bonham's death from alcohol-related asphyxia in 1980. In the decades that followed, the surviving members sporadically collaborated and participated in one-off Led Zeppelin reunions. The most successful of these was the 2007 Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert in London, with Jason Bonham taking his late father's place behind the drums. 
Led Zeppelin are widely considered one of the most successful, innovative, and influential rock groups in history. They are one of the best-selling music artists in the history of audio recording; various sources estimate the group's record sales at 200 to 300 million units worldwide. With RIAA-certified sales of 111.5 million units, they are the second-best-selling band in the United States. Each of their nine studio albums placed in the top 10 of the Billboard album chart and six reached the number-one spot.Rolling Stone magazine described them as ""the heaviest band of all time"", ""the biggest band of the '70s"", and ""unquestionably one of the most enduring bands in rock history"". They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995; the museum's biography of the band states that they were ""as influential"" during the 1970s as the Beatles were during the 1960s. 

History:

Formation:

In 1966, London-based session guitarist Jimmy Page joined the blues-influenced rock band the Yardbirds to replace bassist Paul Samwell-Smith. Page soon switched from bass to lead guitar, creating a dual lead guitar line-up with Jeff Beck. Following Beck's departure in October 1966, the Yardbirds, tired from constant touring and recording, began to wind down. Page wanted to form a supergroup with him and Beck on guitars, and the Who's Keith Moon and John Entwistle on drums and bass, respectively. Vocalists Steve Winwood and Steve Marriott were also considered for the project. The group never formed, although Page, Beck, and Moon did record a song together in 1966, ""Beck's Bolero"", in a session that also included bassist-keyboardist John Paul Jones. 
The Yardbirds played their final gig in July 1968 at Luton College of Technology in Bedfordshire. They were still committed to several concerts in Scandinavia, so drummer Jim McCarty and vocalist Keith Relf authorised Page and bassist Chris Dreja to use ""the Yardbirds"" name to fulfill the band's obligations. Page and Dreja began putting a new line-up together. Page's first choice for the lead singer was Terry Reid, but Reid declined the offer and suggested Robert Plant, a singer for the Band of Joy and Hobbstweedle. Plant eventually accepted the position, recommending former Band of Joy drummer John Bonham. Jones inquired about the vacant position at the suggestion of his wife after Dreja dropped out of the project to become a photographer. Page had known Jones since they were both session musicians and agreed to let him join as the final member. 

The four played together for the first time in a room below a record store on Gerrard Street in London. Page suggested that they attempt ""Train Kept A-Rollin'"", originally a jump blues song popularised in a rockabilly version by Johnny Burnette, which had been covered by the Yardbirds. ""As soon as I heard John Bonham play,"" Jones recalled, ""I knew this was going to be great ... We locked together as a team immediately"". Before leaving for Scandinavia, the group took part in a recording session for the P.J. Proby album, Three Week Hero. The album's track ""Jim's Blues"", with Plant on harmonica, was the first studio track to feature all four future members of Led Zeppelin. 
The band completed the Scandinavian tour as the New Yardbirds, playing together for the first time in front of a live audience at Gladsaxe Teen Clubs in Gladsaxe, Denmark, on 7 September 1968. Later that month, they began recording their first album, which was based on their live set. The album was recorded and mixed in nine days, and Page covered the costs. After the album's completion, the band were forced to change their name after Dreja issued a cease and desist letter, stating that Page was allowed to use the New Yardbirds moniker for the Scandinavian dates only. One account of how the new band's name was chosen held that Moon and Entwistle had suggested that a supergroup with Page and Beck would go down like a ""lead balloon"", an idiom for disastrous results. The group dropped the 'a' in lead at the suggestion of their manager, Peter Grant, so that those unfamiliar with the term would not pronounce it ""leed"". The word ""balloon"" was swapped for ""zeppelin"", a word which, according to music journalist Keith Shadwick, brought ""the perfect combination of heavy and light, combustibility and grace"" to Page's mind. 
In November 1968, Grant secured a $143,000 advance contract from Atlantic Records, which was then the biggest deal of its kind for a new band. Atlantic were a label with a catalogue of mainly blues, soul, and jazz artists, but in the late 1960s they began to take an interest in British progressive rock acts. Record executives signed Led Zeppelin without having ever seen them. Under the terms of their contract, the band had autonomy in deciding when they would release albums and tour, and had the final say over the contents and design of each album. They would also decide how to promote each release and which tracks to release as singles. They formed their own company, Superhype, to handle all publishing rights. 

Early years: 1968-70:
The band began their first tour of the UK on 4 October 1968, still billed as the New Yardbirds, and played their first show as Led Zeppelin at the University of Surrey in Battersea on 25 October. Tour manager Richard Cole, who would become a major figure in the touring life of the group, organised their first North American tour at the end of the year. Their debut album, Led Zeppelin, was released in the US during the tour on 12 January 1969, and peaked at number 10 on the Billboard chart; it was released in the UK, where it peaked at number 6, on 31 March. According to Steve Erlewine, the album's memorable guitar riffs, lumbering rhythms, psychedelic blues, groovy, bluesy shuffles and hints of English folk, made it ""a significant turning point in the evolution of hard rock and heavy metal"". 

In their first year, Led Zeppelin completed four US and four UK concert tours, and also released their second album, Led Zeppelin II. Recorded mostly on the road at various North American studios, it was an even greater commercial success than their first album, and reached the number one chart position in the US and the UK. The album further developed the mostly blues-rock musical style established on their debut release, creating a sound that was ""heavy and hard, brutal and direct"", and which would be highly influential and frequently imitated. Steve Waksman has suggested that Led Zeppelin II was ""the musical starting point for heavy metal"". 
The band saw their albums as indivisible, complete listening experiences, disliking the re-editing of existing tracks for release as singles. Grant maintained an aggressive pro-album stance, particularly in the UK, where there were few radio and TV outlets for rock music. Without the band's consent, however, some songs were released as singles, particularly in the US. In 1969 an edited version of ""Whole Lotta Love"", a track from their second album, was released as a single in the US. It reached number four in the Billboard chart in January 1970, selling over one million copies and helping to cement the band's popularity. The group also increasingly shunned television appearances, citing their preference that their fans hear and see them in live concerts. 
Following the release of their second album, Led Zeppelin completed several more US tours. They played initially in clubs and ballrooms, and then in larger auditoriums as their popularity grew. Some early Led Zeppelin concerts lasted more than four hours, with expanded and improvised live versions of their repertoire. Many of these shows have been preserved as bootleg recordings. It was during this period of intensive concert touring that the band developed a reputation for off-stage excess. 
In 1970 Page and Plant retired to Bron-Yr-Aur, a remote cottage in Wales, to commence work on their third album, Led Zeppelin III. The result was a more acoustic style that was strongly influenced by folk and Celtic music, and showcased the band's versatility. The album's rich acoustic sound initially received mixed reactions, with critics and fans surprised at the turn from the primarily electric arrangements of the first two albums, further fuelling the band's hostility to the musical press. It reached number one in the UK and US charts, but its stay would be the shortest of their first five albums. The album's opening track, ""Immigrant Song"", was released as a US single in November 1970 against the band's wishes, reaching the top twenty on the Billboard chart. 

""The Biggest Band in the World"": 1971-75:

During the 1970s, Led Zeppelin reached new heights of commercial and critical success that made them one of the most influential groups of the era, eclipsing their earlier achievements. The band's image also changed as the members began to wear elaborate, flamboyant clothing. Led Zeppelin began travelling in a private jet airliner, a Boeing 720, (nicknamed the Starship), rented out entire sections of hotels (including the Continental Hyatt House in Los Angeles, known colloquially as the ""Riot House""), and became the subject of frequently repeated stories of debauchery. One involved John Bonham riding a motorcycle through a rented floor of the Riot House, while another involved the destruction of a room in the Tokyo Hilton, leading to the group being banned from that establishment for life. Although Led Zeppelin developed a reputation for trashing their hotel suites and throwing television sets out of the windows, some suggest that these tales have been exaggerated. According to music journalist Chris Welch, ""Led Zeppelin's travels spawned many stories, but it was a myth that they were constantly engaged in acts of wanton destruction and lewd behaviour"". 
Led Zeppelin released their fourth album on 8 November 1971. In response to the treatment they had received from critics, particularly after Led Zeppelin III, the band decided to release the fourth album with no title, though it is variously referred to as Led Zeppelin IV, Untitled, IV, or, due to the four symbols appearing on the record label, as Four Symbols, Zoso or Runes. In addition to lacking a title, the original cover featured no band name, as the group wished to be anonymous and to avoid easy pigeonholing by the press. With 37 million copies sold, Led Zeppelin IV is one of the best-selling albums in history, and its massive popularity cemented Led Zeppelin's status as superstars in the 1970s. By 2006, it had sold 23 million copies in the United States alone. The track ""Stairway to Heaven"", never released as a single, is sometimes quoted as being the most requested and most playedAlbum-oriented rock (AOR) FM radio song. The group followed up the album's release with tours of the UK, Australasia, North America, Japan, and the UK again from late 1971 through early 1973. 

Led Zeppelin's next album, Houses of the Holy, was released in March 1973. It featured further experimentation by the band, who expanded their use of synthesisers and mellotron orchestration. The predominately orange album cover, designed by the London-based design group Hipgnosis, depicts images of nude children climbing the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland. Although the children are not shown from the front, the cover was controversial at the time of the album's release. As with the band's fourth album, neither their name nor the album title was printed on the sleeve. 
Houses of the Holy topped charts worldwide, and the band's subsequent concert tour of North America in 1973 broke records for attendance, as they consistently filled large auditoriums and stadiums. At Tampa Stadium in Florida, they played to 56,800 fans, breaking the record set by the Beatles' 1965 Shea Stadium concert and grossing $309,000. Three sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden in New York City were filmed for a motion picture, but the theatrical release of this project (The Song Remains the Same) was delayed until 1976. Before the final night's performance, $180,000 of the band's money from gate receipts was stolen from a safe deposit box at the Drake Hotel. 

In 1974, Led Zeppelin took a break from touring and launched their own record label, Swan Song, named after an unreleased song. The record label's logo, based on a drawing called Evening: Fall of Day (1869) by William Rimmer, features a picture of Apollo. The logo can be found on Led Zeppelin memorabilia, especially T-shirts. In addition to using Swan Song as a vehicle to promote their own albums, the band expanded the label's roster, signing artists such as Bad Company, the Pretty Things and Maggie Bell. The label was successful while Led Zeppelin existed, but folded less than three years after they disbanded. 
In 1975, Led Zeppelin's double album Physical Graffiti was their first release on the Swan Song label. It consisted of fifteen songs, of which eight had been recorded at Headley Grange in 1974 and seven had been recorded earlier. A review in Rolling Stone magazine referred to Physical Graffiti as Led Zeppelin's ""bid for artistic respectability"", adding that the only bands Led Zeppelin had to compete with for the title ""The World's Best Rock Band"" were the Rolling Stones and the Who. The album was a massive commercial and critical success. Shortly after the release of Physical Graffiti, all previous Led Zeppelin albums simultaneously re-entered the top-200 album chart, and the band embarked on another North American tour, now employing sophisticated sound and lighting systems. In May 1975, Led Zeppelin played five sold-out nights at the Earls Court Arena in London, at the time the largest arena in Britain. 

Hiatus from touring and return: 1975-77:

Following their triumphant Earls Court appearances, Led Zeppelin took a holiday and planned an autumn tour in America, scheduled to open with two outdoor dates in San Francisco. In August 1975, however, Plant and his wife Maureen were involved in a serious car crash while on holiday in Rhodes, Greece. Plant suffered a broken ankle and Maureen was badly injured; a blood transfusion saved her life. Unable to tour, he headed to the Channel Island of Jersey to spend August and September recuperating, with Bonham and Page in tow. The band then reconvened in Malibu, California. During this forced hiatus much of the material for their next album, Presence, was written. 
By this time, Led Zeppelin were the world's number one rock attraction, having outsold most bands of the time, including the Rolling Stones.Presence, released in March 1976, marked a change in the Led Zeppelin sound towards more straightforward, guitar-based jams, departing from the acoustic ballads and intricate arrangements featured on their previous albums. Though it was a platinum seller, Presence received a mixed reaction among fans and the music press, with some critics suggesting that the band's excesses may have caught up with them. Page had begun using heroin during recording sessions for the album, a habit which may have affected the band's later live shows and studio recordings, although this has been denied by Page. 
Because of Plant's injuries, Led Zeppelin did not tour in 1976. Instead, the band completed the concert film The Song Remains the Same and the accompanying soundtrack album. The film premiered in New York City on 20 October 1976, but was given a lukewarm reception by critics and fans. The film was particularly unsuccessful in the UK, where, unwilling to tour since 1975 because of their tax exile status, Led Zeppelin faced an uphill battle to recapture the public's affection. 

In 1977, Led Zeppelin embarked on another major concert tour of North America. The band set another attendance record, with an audience of 76,229 at their Silverdome concert on 30 April. It was, according to the Guinness Book of Records, the largest attendance to that date for a single act show. Although the tour was financially profitable, it was beset by off-stage problems. On 19 April, over 70 people were arrested as about 1,000 fans tried to gatecrash Cincinnati Riverfront Coliseum for two sold-out concerts, while others tried to gain entry by throwing rocks and bottles through glass doors. On 3 June, a concert at Tampa Stadium was cut short because of a severe thunderstorm, despite tickets indicating ""Rain or Shine"". A riot broke out, resulting in arrests and injuries. 
After the 23 July show at the Day on the Green festival at the Oakland Coliseum in Oakland, California, Bonham and members of Led Zeppelin's support staff were arrested after a member of promoter Bill Graham's staff was badly beaten during the band's performance. The following day's second Oakland concert was the group's final live appearance in the United States. Two days later, as they checked in at a French Quarter hotel for their 30 July performance at the Louisiana Superdome, Plant received news that his five-year-old son, Karac, had died from a stomach virus. The rest of the tour was immediately cancelled, prompting widespread speculation about Led Zeppelin's future. 

Bonham's death and break-up: 1978-80:

In November 1978 the group recorded at Polar Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. The resulting album, In Through the Out Door, featured sonic experimentation that again drew mixed reactions from critics. Nevertheless, the album reached number one in the UK and the US in just its second week of release. With this album's release, Led Zeppelin's entire catalogue returned to the Billboard Top 200 in the weeks of 27 October and 3 November 1979. 
In August 1979, after two warm-up shows in Copenhagen, Led Zeppelin headlined two concerts at the Knebworth Music Festival, playing to a crowd of approximately 104,000 on the first night. A brief, low-key European tour was undertaken in June and July 1980, featuring a stripped-down set without the usual lengthy jams and solos. On 27 June, at a show in Nuremberg, Germany, the concert came to an abrupt halt in the middle of the third song, when Bonham collapsed onstage and was rushed to hospital. Speculation in the press suggested that his collapse had been the result of excessive alcohol and drug use, but the band claimed that he had simply overeaten. 
A North American tour, the band's first since 1977, was scheduled to commence on 17 October 1980. On 24 September, Bonham was picked up by Led Zeppelin assistant Rex King to attend rehearsals at Bray Studios. During the journey, Bonham asked to stop for breakfast, where he downed four quadruple vodkas (450 ml/15 oz.), with a ham roll. After taking a bite of the ham roll he said to his assistant, ""breakfast"". He continued to drink heavily after arriving at the studio. The rehearsals were halted late that evening and the band retired to Page's house--the Old Mill House in Clewer, Windsor. After midnight, Bonham, who had fallen asleep, was taken to bed and placed on his side. At 1:45 pm the next day, Benji LeFevre (Led Zeppelin's new tour manager) and John Paul Jones found Bonham dead. The cause of death was asphyxiation from vomit; an autopsy found no other drugs in his body. Bonham was cremated on 10 October 1980, and his ashes were buried in the graveyard of St Michael's Church in Rushock near Droitwich, Worcestershire. A verdict of accidental death was returned at an inquest held on 27 October. 
The planned North American tour was cancelled, and despite rumours that Cozy Powell, Carmine Appice, Barriemore Barlow, Simon Kirke, or Bev Bevan would join the group as his replacement, the remaining members decided to disband. A 4 December 1980 press statement stated that, ""We wish it to be known that the loss of our dear friend, and the deep sense of undivided harmony felt by ourselves and our manager, have led us to decide that we could not continue as we were"". The statement was signed simply ""Led Zeppelin"". 

Post-breakup:

1980s:

Following the dissolution of Led Zeppelin, the first significant project for the band members was the Honeydrippers, which Plant initially formed in 1981, and which released its only album in 1984. The group featured Page on lead guitar, along with studio musicians and friends of Plant and Page, including Jeff Beck, Paul Shaffer, and Nile Rodgers. Plant focused the band in a different direction from Led Zeppelin, playing standards and in a more R&B style, highlighted by their cover of ""Sea of Love"", which peaked at number three on the Billboard charts in early 1985. 
Coda, which was a collection of outtakes and unused tracks from the band's career, was released in November 1982. It included two tracks taken from the band's performance at the Royal Albert Hall in 1970, one each from the Led Zeppelin III and Houses of the Holy sessions, and three from the In Through the Out Door sessions. It also featured a 1976 Bonham drum instrumental with electronic effects added by Page, called ""Bonzo's Montreux"". 
On 13 July 1985, Page, Plant, and Jones reunited for the Live Aid concert at JFK Stadium, Philadelphia, playing a short set featuring drummers Tony Thompson and Phil Collins and bassist Paul Martinez. Collins had contributed to Plant's first two solo albums while Martinez was a member of Plant's group Band of Joy. The performance was marred by the lack of rehearsal with the two drummers, Page's struggles with an out-of-tune guitar, poorly functioning monitors, and by Plant's hoarse voice. Page described the performance as ""pretty shambolic"", while Plant characterised it as an ""atrocity"". 
The three members reunited again on 14 May 1988, for the Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary concert, with Bonham's son, Jason Bonham, on drums. The result was another disjointed performance, after Plant and Page had argued immediately prior to coming on stage about whether to play ""Stairway to Heaven"", and with the complete loss of Jones' keyboards on the live television feed. Page described the performance as ""one big disappointment"", and Plant said that ""the gig was foul"". 

1990s:

The first Led Zeppelin box set, featuring tracks remastered under Page's supervision, was released in 1990 and bolstered the band's reputation, leading to abortive discussions among members about a reunion. This set included four previously unreleased tracks, including a version of Robert Johnson's ""Travelling Riverside Blues"". The song peaked at number seven on the Billboard Album Rock Tracks chart. 1992 saw the release of the ""Immigrant Song""/""Hey Hey What Can I Do"" (the original B-side) as a CD single in the US.Led Zeppelin Boxed Set 2 was released in 1993; the two box sets together containing all known studio recordings, as well as some rare live tracks. 
In 1994, Page and Plant reunited for a 90-minute ""UnLedded"" MTV project. They later released an album called No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded, which featured some reworked Led Zeppelin songs, and embarked on a world tour the following year. This is said to be the beginning of a rift between the band members, as Jones was not even told of the reunion. 
In 1995, Led Zeppelin were inducted into the United States Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Steven Tyler and Joe Perry of Aerosmith. Jason and Zoë Bonham also attended, representing their late father. At the induction ceremony, the band's inner rift became apparent when Jones joked upon accepting his award, ""Thank you, my friends, for finally remembering my phone number"", causing consternation and awkward looks from Page and Plant. Afterwards, they played one brief set with Tyler and Perry, with Jason Bonham on drums, and then a second with Neil Young, this time with Michael Lee playing the drums. 
In 1997, Atlantic released a single edit of ""Whole Lotta Love"" in the US and the UK, the only single the band released in their homeland, where it peaked at number 21. November 1997 saw the release of Led Zeppelin BBC Sessions, a two-disc set largely recorded in 1969 and 1971. Page and Plant released another album called Walking into Clarksdale in 1998, featuring all new material, but after disappointing sales the partnership dissolved before a planned Australian tour. 

2000s and beyond:

2003 saw the release of the triple live album How the West Was Won, and Led Zeppelin DVD, a six-hour chronological set of live footage that became the best-selling music DVD in history. In July 2007 Atlantic/Rhino and Warner Home Video announced three new Led Zeppelin titles to be released that November. First was Mothership, a 24-track best-of spanning the band's career, followed by a reissue of the soundtrack The Song Remains the Same, which included previously unreleased material, and a new DVD. Led Zeppelin also made their catalogue legally available for digital download, becoming one of the last major rock bands to do so. 
On 10 December 2007, Led Zeppelin reunited for the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert at the O2 Arena in London, with Jason Bonham again taking his late father's place on drums. According to Guinness World Records 2009, Led Zeppelin set the world record for the ""Highest Demand for Tickets for One Music Concert"" as 20 million requests for the reunion show were rendered online. Music critics praised the band's performance and there was widespread speculation about a full reunion. Page, Jones and Jason Bonham were reported to be willing to tour, and to be working on material for a new Led Zeppelin project. Plant continued his touring commitments with Alison Krauss, stating in September 2008 that he would not be recording or touring with the band. Jones and Page reportedly looked for a replacement for Plant, considering singers including Steven Tyler, and Myles Kennedy of Alter Bridge, but in January 2009 it was confirmed that the project had been abandoned. A film of the O2 performance, Celebration Day, premiered on 17 October 2012 and was released on home video on 19 November. The film grossed $2 million in one night, and the live album peaked at number 4 and 9 in the UK and US, respectively. Following the film's premiere, Page revealed that he had been remastering the band's discography with the first three albums re-released on 2 June 2014, containing bonus tracks. 

Musical style:

Led Zeppelin's music was rooted in the blues. The influence of American blues artists such as Muddy Waters and Skip James was particularly apparent on their first two albums, as was the distinct country blues style of Howlin' Wolf. Tracks were structured around the twelve-bar blues on every studio album except for one, and the blues directly and indirectly influenced other songs both musically and lyrically. The band were also strongly influenced by the music of the British, Celtic, and American folk revivals. Scottish folk guitarist Bert Jansch helped inspire Page, and from him he adapted open tunings and aggressive strokes into his playing. The band also drew on a wide variety of genres, including world music, and elements of early rock and roll, jazz, country, funk, soul, and reggae, particularly on Houses of the Holy and the albums that followed. 
The material on the first two albums was largely constructed out of extended jams of blues standards and folk songs. This method led to the mixing of musical and lyrical elements of different songs and versions, as well as improvised passages, to create new material, but would lead to later accusations of plagiarism and legal disputes over copyright. Usually the music was developed first, sometimes with improvised lyrics that might then be rewritten for the final version of the song. From the visit to Bron-Yr-Aur in 1970, the songwriting partnership between Page and Plant became predominant, with Page supplying the music, largely via his acoustic guitar, and Plant emerging as the band's chief lyricist. Jones and Bonham then added to the material, in rehearsal or in the studio, as a song was developed. In the later stages of the band's career, Page took a back seat in composition and Jones became increasingly important in producing music, often composed on the keyboard. Plant would then add lyrics before Page and Bonham developed their parts. 

Early lyrics drew on the band's blues and folk roots, often mixing lyrical fragments from different songs. Many of the band's songs dealt with themes of romance, unrequited love and sexual conquest, which were common in rock, pop and blues music. Some of their lyrics, especially those derived from the blues, have been interpreted as misogynistic. Particularly on Led Zeppelin III, they incorporated elements of mythology and mysticism into their music, which largely grew out of Plant's interest in legends and history. These elements were often taken to reflect Page's interest in the occult, which resulted in accusations that the recordings contained subliminal satanic messages, some of which were said to be contained in backmasking; these claims were generally dismissed by the band and music critics. Susan Fast argues that as Plant emerged as the band's main lyricist, the songs more obviously reflected his alignment with the West Coast counterculture of the 1960s. In the later part of the band's career Plant's lyrics became more autobiographical, and less optimistic, drawing on his own experiences and circumstances. 
According to musicologist Robert Walser, ""Led Zeppelin's sound was marked by speed and power, unusual rhythmic patterns, contrasting terraced dynamics, singer Robert Plant's wailing vocals, and guitarist Jimmy Page's heavily distorted crunch"". These elements mean that they are often cited as one of the progenitors of hard rock and heavy metal and they have been described as the ""definitive heavy metal band"", although the band members have often eschewed the label. Part of this reputation depends on the band's use of distorted guitar riffs on songs like ""Whole Lotta Love"" and ""The Wanton Song"". Often riffs were not doubled by guitar, bass and drums exactly, but instead there were melodic or rhythmic variations; as in ""Black Dog"", where three different time signatures are used. Page's guitar playing incorporated elements of the blues scale with those of eastern music. Plant's use of high-pitched shrieks has been compared to Janis Joplin's vocal technique. Bonham's drumming was noted for its power, his rapid rolls and his fast beats on a single bass drum. Jones' basslines have been described as melodic and his keyboard playing added a classical touch to the band's sound. 
Page stated that he wanted Led Zeppelin to produce music that had ""light and shade"". This began to be more clearly realised beginning with Led Zeppelin III, which made greater use of acoustic instruments. This approach has been seen as exemplified in the fourth album, particularly on ""Stairway to Heaven"", which begins with acoustic guitar and recorder and ends with drums and heavy electric sounds. Towards the end of their recording career, they moved to a more mellow and progressive sound, dominated by Jones' keyboard motifs. They also increasingly made use of various layering and production techniques, including multi-tracking and overdubbed guitar parts. Their emphasis on the sense of dynamics and ensemble arrangement has been seen as producing an individualistic style that transcends any single music genre. Ian Peddie argues that they were ""... loud, powerful and often heavy, but their music was also humorous, self-reflective and extremely subtle"". 

Legacy:

Led Zeppelin are widely considered to be one of the most successful, innovative, and influential rock bands in the history of music. Rock critic Mikal Gilmore said, ""Led Zeppelin--talented, complex, grasping, beautiful and dangerous--made one of the most enduring bodies of composition and performance in twentieth-century music, despite everything they had to overpower, including themselves"". 
Led Zeppelin have influenced hard rock and heavy metal bands such as Deep Purple,Black Sabbath,Rush,Queen, and Megadeth as well as progressive metal bands like Tool and Dream Theater. They influenced some early punk and post-punk bands, among them the Ramones and the Cult. They were also an important influence on the development of alternative rock, as bands adapted elements from the ""Zeppelin sound"" of the mid-1970s, including the Smashing Pumpkins,Nirvana,Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden. Bands and artists from diverse genres have acknowledged the influence of Led Zeppelin, such as Madonna,Shakira,Lady Gaga, and Katie Melua. 

Led Zeppelin have been credited with a major impact on the nature of the music business, particularly in the development of album-orientated rock (AOR) and stadium rock. In 1988 John Kalodner, then-A&R executive of Geffen Records, remarked that ""In my opinion, next to the Beatles they're the most influential band in history. They influence the way music is on records, AOR radio, concerts. They set the standards for the AOR-radio format with 'Stairway to Heaven,' having AOR hits without necessarily having Top 40 hits. They're the ones who did the first real big arena concert shows, consistently selling out and playing stadiums without support. People can do as well as them, but nobody surpasses them"".Andrew Loog Oldham, the former producer and manager of the Rolling Stones, commented on how Led Zeppelin had a major influence on the record business, and the way rock concerts were managed and presented to huge audiences. 
The band have sold over 200 million albums worldwide according to some sources, while others state that they have sold in excess of 300 million records, including 111.5 million certified units in the United States. According to the Recording Industry Association of America, Led Zeppelin are the second-highest-selling band, the fourth highest selling music act in the US, and one of only three acts to earn four or more Diamond albums. Led Zeppelin remain one of the most bootlegged artists in the history of rock music. 
Led Zeppelin also made a significant cultural impact. Jim Miller, editor of Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll, argues that ""on one level, Led Zeppelin represents the final flowering of the sixties' psychedelic ethic, which casts rock as passive sensory involvement"". Led Zeppelin have also been described as ""the quintessential purveyors"" of masculine and aggressive ""cock rock"", although this assertion has been challenged. The band's fashion-sense has been seminal; Simeon Lipman, head of pop culture at Christie's auction house, has commented that ""Led Zeppelin have had a big influence on fashion because the whole aura surrounding them is so cool, and people want a piece of that"". Led Zeppelin laid the foundation for the big hair of 1980s glam metal bands such as Mötley Crüe and Skid Row. Other musicians have also adapted elements from Led Zeppelin's attitude to clothes, jewellery and hair, such as the hipster flares and tight band T-shirts of Kings of Leon, shaggy hair, clingy T-shirts and bluesman hair of Jack White of the White Stripes, and Kasabian guitarist Sergio Pizzorno's silk scarves, trilbies and side-laced tight jeans. 

Awards and accolades:

Led Zeppelin have collected many honours and awards throughout the course of their career. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006. Among the band's awards are an American Music Award in 2005, and the Polar Music Prize in 2006. Led Zeppelin were the recipient of a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005, and four of their recordings have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. They have been awarded five Diamond albums, as well as fourteen Multi-Platinum, four Platinum and one Gold album in the United States, while in the UK they have five Multi-Platinum, six Platinum, one Gold and four Silver albums. In addition to listing five of their albums among ""the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time"", Rolling Stone named Led Zeppelin the 14th-greatest artist of all time in 2004. 
In 2005, Page was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in recognition of his charity work, and in 2009 Plant was honoured as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his services to popular music. The band are ranked number one on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock and Classic Rock‍ '​s ""50 best live acts of all time"". They were named as the best Rock band in a poll by BBC Radio 2. They were awarded an Ivor Novello Award for ""Outstanding Contribution to British Music"" in 1977, as well as a ""Lifetime Achievement Award"" at the 42nd Annual Ivor Novello awards ceremony in 1997. The band were honoured at the 2008 MOJO Awards with the ""Best Live Act"" prize for their one-off reunion, and were described as the ""greatest rock and roll band of all time"".

The group has released several EPs including their debut Young Liars (2003), and five studio albums: Desperate Youth, Blood Thirsty Babes (2004), Return to Cookie Mountain (2006), Dear Science (2008), Nine Types of Light (2011), and Seeds (2014).  For most of the band's existence, the core TV on the Radio lineup has been Tunde Adebimpe (vocals/loops),  David Andrew Sitek (guitars/keyboards/loops),  Kyp Malone  (vocals/guitars/bass/loops),  Jaleel Bunton  (drums/vocals/loops/guitars) and Gerard Smith  (bass/keyboards) as official members.  The band's Bio from their website: TV on the Radio gets to do anything. Like a small platoon whose pleasing impenetrability is their core, the band consistently confounds expectations while managing to balance respect from critics and peers alike. The result is TV on the Radio gets to do anything they want. This freedom is their engine.  ""It's about doing what feels right,"" says singer Tunde Adebimpe. ""I really feel like this band is something that is expansive and always changing and growing. If we wear our influences on our sleeve, it's a pretty crowded sleeve.""  It's no different with Seeds, the new and fifth proper studio album that Adebimpe has made along with Jaleel Bunton, Kyp Malone, and David Andrew Sitek (who also produced it). Having long outlasted that early 2000s fascination with all things Brooklyn to which the hip willfully succumbed, they continue to conquer music on their own terms. This album serves as another step in continuing to heed their reputation as ""the most vital, current band in America"" (Associated Press).    This go-round the songs are immediate and triumphant, textured with storytelling hooks and possibly the most honest music this band has ever composed. They've hit a point where they're OK being straight-up beautiful without having to manipulate prettiness into whatever unforeseen shape.  Slate says Seeds has ""TV on the Radio's best songs in years.  They are sounding sharper than ever."" And the band knows it. Adebimpe has already said this is the band's best record. Not a boast, just an observation.  ""I feel like I knew it before we were done,"" he says immediately. ""I was so excited by the songs while we were making them, I wanted to get more and more and more into it. The general feeling going into it was, 'We're still here. Our friendship with each other is so strong. Being in a band, at its best times, is like being... well, let's say whenever things are going really well, we're like 'cool, Voltron's back together.'""  The TV on the Radio guys are the type of people who go on hiatus and focus on music. They may take time between albums for their other endeavors, but they know when it's right to come together - especially when the music comes as easily and passionately as it did with case Seeds. The band found themselves collected in David Sitek's Los Angeles studio last year and recorded a couple of songs - ""Mercy"" and ""Million Miles"" and didn't want to stop.  ""Those were just songs that we wrote because we hadn't written songs together in a while,"" says Sitek ""They came out really fast and inspired us to do it again - and then 'again' turned into the record.""  Adebimpe and Sitek live in Los Angeles, Bunton and Malone reside in New York, but make no mistake: TV on the Radio is a quartet. To attempt to parse out exactly what each member does in the group would be to dismantle the fundamental essence of what makes TV on the Radio the monolithic anomaly they have been careful to cultivate and protect for more than a decade. They permeate beyond a wall of sound, and instead create a planetarium of music with every song. They embody many voices. Most of them can play just about anything. And sing too. They are equal partners in the creation of a type of noise that appeared seemingly out of nowhere over 10 years ago.  Throughout the years, TV on the Radio has been consistent in the standard they set for themselves. Earlier records, Desperate Youth, Blood Thirsty Babes and Return To Cookie Mountain stole the hearts of fans and critics alike just the same, winning the Shortlist Music Prize and Spin's Album of the Year respectively. Their breakout release Dear Science was named best album of 2008 by Rolling Stone, The Guardian, Spin Magazine, The New York Times, The Onion AV Club, MTV, even Entertainment Weekly. An embarrassment of riches, really. Their last album, 2011's Nine Types of Light, was deemed ""pure heaven"" by the cherubs at Rolling Stone, and earned the band a Grammy® nomination. The band has also graced the stages of Saturday Night Live and The Colbert Report.   ""The band is it's own 'self.' It has to be that way,"" Adebimpe says. ""That's been the goal for a long time. Nobody really wants to be the focal point for the band; the band should be the focal point. Not even the band: the music. We can show up and take credit for it, but ultimately it's something that maybe we helped shape and facilitate coming into the world. But that's all.""  They happily recruit likeminded associates to help prop up this invention of theirs in the studio and on stage. (Kelis, for instance, appears on ""Lazzeray""). The band has recorded and performed with other artists who've conquered the music world on their own terms just as much as they have. Fellow mavericks like Trent Reznor, Nick Zinner of Yeah Yeah Yeahs fame, Bauhaus singer Peter Murphy, Kazu Makino of Blonde Redhead, Martin Perna of Antibalas, Katrina Ford of Celebration, and David chuffing Bowie have all romped in the sandbox with TV on the Radio.  ""If you share a material thing, it dissipates,"" Adebimpe says, recalling a fragment of philosophy he once heard, or might be improvising on the spot. ""If you share a spiritual thing, it just increases. It becomes more and more and more. I'm already thinking about the next record.""  Seeds is an expression of everything this band has been through in the last three years and more. They're influential, in their prime, they're TV on the Radio, and they've proven themselves to be one of the most important bands of this generation. It clicks, as it always does, and TV on the Radio is brand new again, again.   ""No matter what you go through individually and collectively, when you step away from each other, you're kind of like, ""I know that if we get together we can fire this thing,"" says Adebimpe. ""It's definitely in the spirit of the punk rock we all grew up with. If you win, you're still a punk. If you lose, you're still a punk, and honestly, it's not about anybody else.""  http://www.tvontheradio.com/, The '50s through the '80s were proud times in New ..., The Brooklyn-based group TV on the Radio mixes post-punk, electronic, ..., ...... .. .. .. .. ......Dear Listener,..This ..Family.. made by ..., The Brooklyn-based group TV on the Radio mix post-punk, electronic, ..., This Family made by the confluence of desire &amp; circumstance ..., The Brooklyn-based group TV on the Radio mix post-punk, electronic, ..., The Brooklyn-based group TV on the Radio mix post-punk, electronic, ..., From their beginnings as Brooklyn-based experimenters to one of the ..., EIGHT THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THE TEN SONGS ON ..., TV on the Radio are an American indie rock band formed in 2001 in Brooklyn, New York.

Other contributors have included David Bowie, Nick Zinner of Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, Kazu Makino of Blonde Redhead, Martin Perna of Antibalas, and Katrina Ford of Celebration. 

History:
The first release from TV on the Radio (initially just founding members Adebimpe and Sitek) was the self-released OK Calculator (the title being a reference to Radiohead's album OK Computer). They were later joined by Kyp Malone, and released the Young Liars EP in 2003. This was followed by the full-length Desperate Youth, Blood Thirsty Babes which earned the band the 2004 Shortlist Music Prize. They released a second EP, New Health Rock, later that year. 
Their third album, Return to Cookie Mountain, leaked in early 2006 and garnered pre-release praise from Pitchfork Media before its official release in July overseas. U.S. and Canadian release was in September on Interscope. Spin magazine named Return to Cookie Mountain its Album of the Year for 2006. The album features guest appearances from David Bowie, Omega Moon, Celebration, Dragons of Zynth, Martin Perna and Stuart D. Bogie of Antibalas, Blonde Redhead, Yeah Yeah Yeahs' Nick Zinner. Bowie contributed back-up vocals on the song ""Province"". In promotion of the album, the band performed "" Wolf Like Me"" on the Late Show with David Letterman, which has garnered over 2 million views on YouTube. During the U.S. tour, the band performed a few covers with Bauhaus singer Peter Murphy and Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor. 
The band's fourth album, Dear Science, was released September 23, 2008 on Interscope. It was made available for streaming on their Myspace page and subsequently leaked onto the internet on September 6, 2008. The album was named the best album of 2008 by Rolling Stone,The Guardian,Spin magazine,The Onion AV Club,MTV,Entertainment Weekly, the Pitchfork Media's readers poll as well as the Pazz and Jop critic's poll. It was also named the second best album of 2008 by NME and the fourth best album of 2008 by Planet Sound. 
On September 22, 2008, TV on the Radio performed ""Dancing Choose"" in the setting of a flight of outer apartment stairs on the Late Show with David Letterman. They also appeared on Later... with Jools Holland on September 30, 2008, performing ""Golden Age"" and ""Dancing Choose"", which were the same songs they performed on Saturday Night Live on February 7, 2009. The band performed ""Dancing Choose"" on the February 9, 2009 episode of The Colbert Report. 
On September 3, 2009, Tunde Adebimpe announced that TV on the Radio would be taking a year-long hiatus. Guitarist Kyp Malone's solo album, under the name Rain Machine, was released on September 22, 2009 on ANTI-. A solo album by Dave Sitek, Maximum Balloon, was released August 24, 2010 on Interscope, featuring a variety of guest vocals by many of his musician friends such as Karen O, David Byrne, and both of his TV on the Radio vocalist bandmates, and numerous others. In addition, Sitek produced Holly Miranda's album The Magician's Private Library, which also featured fellow TV on the Radio members Jaleel Bunton and Kyp Malone. 
In March 2010 the band's lead vocalist, Tunde Adebimpe, designed a charity t-shirt for the Yellow Bird Project to raise money for Haiti Relief via Partners in Health. 
On February 7, 2011, the band announced an end to their hiatus, along with their upcoming album Nine Types of Light. 
On April 12, 2011, the album Nine Types of Light was released along with a one-hour film under the same name containing music videos for all the songs on the album as well as interviews with various New Yorkers. The film was directed by various directors under the supervision of Tunde Adebimpe. 
It was announced in March 2011, that the band's bassist, Gerard Smith, was diagnosed with lung cancer. On April 20, 2011, the band announced the death of Gerard Smith on their homepage: ""We are very sad to announce the death of our beloved friend and bandmate, Gerard Smith, following a courageous fight against lung cancer. Gerard passed away the morning of April 20th, 2011. We will miss him terribly."" 
In May 2013, the band headlined and curated the All Tomorrow's Parties music festival held at Pontins holiday camp in Camber Sands, England, at which they debuted the new song ""Mercy."" The band began streaming the studio version of ""Mercy"" online on July 30, 2013 and released the song for sale on digital music outlets a short time later. The band also made the multitracks from Mercy available to fans so they could make their own remixes. The next single ""Million Miles."" was released digitally a few months later. Both songs were later released physically on either side of a 12 Inch single, released through Dave Sitek's Federal Prism label. 
On November 8, 2013, via their Facebook page, the band announced they were at work on a new album. The band made an official announcement July 29, 2014, that this new album, titled Seeds, was scheduled for a late 2014 release. 
In early 2015, it was announced that the band would perform at the Shaky Knees and Boston Calling Music Festivals in May 2015.  On April 9, 2015 they announced a 2015 North American Summer Tour to promote the new album. The tour begins in May & run through a concert in Morrison, CO at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre on July 27th. 

Style and influences:
TV on the Radio has said that their eclectic music is due to their liking of very diverse bands, including Bad Brains, Earth, Wind & Fire, Nancy Sinatra, Serge Gainsbourg,Brian Eno, and the Pixies. Adebimpe covered the Pixies song ""Mr. Grieves"" under the TV on the Radio moniker at the beginning of his career, layering his voice over forty times. The band has also cited Prince's ""Purple Rain"" as a classic. TV on the Radio also named post-punk acts Wire and Siouxsie and the Banshees. Sitek stated: ""I've always tried to make a song that begins like Siouxsie's ""Kiss Them For Me"" ... with that element of surprise mode where all of a sudden this giant drum comes in"".

The band currently consists of Colin Meloy (vocals, guitar), Chris Funk (guitar, mandolin, dulcimer, pedal steel guitar), Jenny Conlee (organ, piano, accordion), Nate Query (electric bass, acoustic bass, cello) and John Moen (drums). Notable former members include Rachel Blumberg (drums, vocals) and Jesse Emerson (bass). The band's most recent album, The King Is Dead was released on 17 January 2011.  Named both in reference to the Russian Decembrist Revolt (they use the national anthem of the Soviet Union as an introduction at many concerts) and to the atmosphere associated with the month of December, the Decemberists write songs that range from upbeat pop to instrumentally lush ballads. They often employ instruments like the accordion, Hammond organ, Wurlitzer organ, and upright bass. In their lyrics, they eschew the angst and introspection common to modern rock, instead favoring a storytelling approach, as evidenced in songs such as ""My Mother Was a Chinese Trapeze Artist"" from the 5 Songs EP and ""The Mariner's Revenge Song"" on Picaresque. Their songs convey tales ranging from whimsical (""Here I Dreamt I Was an Architect"") to epic (""The Tain"") to truly dark (""Odalisque""). They often invoke historical events and themes from around the world. Early in their career, The Decemberists' musical and lyrical aesthetics frequently prompted critics to compare them to Neutral Milk Hotel. Since their debut, their sound has undergone a consistent evolution, most notably in the direction of progressive rock with a strong folk influence, though they have also been described as indie rock and, by Stephen Colbert, as ""hyper-literate prog rock."" For example, one song, ""When the War Came"", uses a little-known story from the Siege of Leningrad to describe the heroism of civilian scientists during warfare. The lyrics state: ""We made our oath to Vavilov / We'd not betray the solanum / The acres of asteraceae / To our own pangs of starvation"". Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov was a Russian botanist whose laboratory, a seedbank containing 200,000 types of plant seeds, many of them edible, was preserved throughout the siege, during which hundreds of thousands of people died.  In March 2005, the Decemberists were reportedly the first band to distribute a music video via BitTorrent -- the self-produced ""16 Military Wives"" (from Picaresque). That same month, the band's equipment trailer was stolen; fans contributed to a replacement fund, and another fund-raiser was organized via an eBay auction, with buyers bidding for copies of Colin Meloy Sings Morrissey and original art work by Carson Ellis. They also received help from Lee Kruger, The Shins, The Dandy Warhols and other musicians. The Martin Guitar Company offered six- and twelve-string guitars on permanent loan. In early April, police discovered the trailer in Clackamas, Oregon, and a fair amount of the band's merchandise, but the instruments and equipment were not recovered.  On 12 December 2005, Meloy revealed to Pitchfork Media that they had signed to Capitol Records, and planned to begin recording their major label debut with producers Tucker Martine and Chris Walla, of Death Cab for Cutie fame, in April 2006. The Decemberists' first album on Capitol, and their first major label debut, The Crane Wife, was released on 3 October 2006. The release was accompanied by an appearance the same day on the world-wide syndicated TV talk show Late Night with Conan O'Brien when the track ""O Valencia!"" was performed. The Decemberists began their tour in support of The Crane Wife, with The Rout of the Patagons Tour, on 17 October 2006, at Portland, Oregon's Crystal Ballroom. Their opening act was Lavender Diamond. Later on in the tour, Alasdair Roberts opened for the band.  In July 2007 the Decemberists set out on a five-date tour with a full orchestral accompaniment. On 7 July, the tour put the group on the stage of the historic Hollywood Bowl for the first time in their career, and they were joined by the Los Angeles Philharmonic.  On 15 July the group performed with The Mann Festival Orchestra at The Mann Center for the Performing Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They then played a free concert in Chicago, Ilinois, at the recently developed Millennium Park with the Grant Park Symphony Orchestra. In September 2007 they also played at Austin City Limits Music Festival in Austin, Texas.  In October 2007, they began The Long and Short of It Tour. However, having completed the European portion of the tour and immediately after playing the Chicago dates, the rest of the tour was canceled due to illness.  On 24 March 2009, the band released The Hazards of Love, their fifth album. The album's first single, ""The Rake's Song"", was made available for free on the band's website. The album featured guest appearances from My Brightest Diamond, Becky Stark of Lavender Diamond, Robyn Hitchcock and Jim James. The album peaked at #14 on the Billboard 200.  On 11 January 2011, the band released their sixth album The King Is Dead. The band released the first single ""Down by the Water"" for free on their website. The album debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 album chart in the United States and is the highest charting album in the band's career.

The band's debut EP, 5 Songs, was self-released in 2001. Their seventh full-length album What a Terrible World, What a Beautiful World was released on January 20, 2015, by Capitol Records, and is the band's fourth record with the label. 
In addition to their lyrics, which often focus on historical incidents and/or folklore, The Decemberists are also well known for their eclectic live shows. Audience participation is often a part of each performance, typically during encores. The band stages whimsical reenactments of sea battles and other centuries-old events, typically of regional interest, or acts out songs with members of the crowd. 
In 2011, the track ""Down By the Water"" from the album The King Is Dead was nominated for Best Rock Song at the 54th Grammy Awards. 

Musical style:

The group's songs range from upbeat pop to instrumentally lush ballads, and often employ instruments like the accordion, Hammond organ, Wurlitzer organ, and upright bass. In its lyrics, the band eschews the introspection common to modern rock, instead favoring a storytelling approach, as evidenced in songs such as ""My Mother Was a Chinese Trapeze Artist"" from the 5 Songs EP and ""The Mariner's Revenge Song"" on Picaresque. The band's songs convey tales ranging from whimsical (""The Sporting Life"") to epic (""The Tain"") to dark (""Odalisque"", ""The Rake's Song"") to political (""16 Military Wives"", ""Valerie Plame""), and often invoke historical events and themes from around the world (""Yankee Bayonet"", ""Shankill Butchers""). 

Influences and character:
On their website, the group claim that their official drink is Orangina, that they love the video game Bioshock and ""adore"" the bands Norfolk & Western, Explosions In The Sky, The Postal Service, The Long Winters, Death Cab for Cutie, Dokken, Tycho, El Ten Eleven, The Shins, The Octopus Project, Electrelane, Camera Obscura, Clearlake, The Thermals, Modest Mouse, Swords and Earlimart. The band's official biography, keeping up their reputation for grandiloquence, also describes how they met in a Turkish bath. A footnote following the biography claims, ""The Decemberists travel exclusively by Dr. Herring's Brand Dirigible Balloons."" Colin Meloy has listed Anne Briggs, Nic Jones, and Shirley Collins - who led the 1960s British folk revival - as major influences on The Hazards of Love. Meloy has also confessed a ""slavish love"" for Morrissey, one of his principal influences. The band has also cited their liking for Siouxsie and the Banshees, and the pop tunes of R.E.M. and XTC. The band also draws inspiration from British and Irish folk music. 

History:

2000: Formation:
The Decemberists formed in 2000 when Colin Meloy left his band Tarkio in Montana and moved to Portland, Oregon. There he met Nate Query, who introduced Meloy to Jenny Conlee (they had played together in the band Calobo) and the three scored a silent film together. Playing a solo show prior to meeting Query, Meloy met Chris Funk. Funk was a fan of Tarkio and played pedal steel on the first two Decemberists releases, not ""officially"" becoming a member until the third effort. The band's first drummer, Ezra Holbrook, was replaced by Rachel Blumberg after Castaways and Cutouts, who in turn was replaced by John Moen after Picaresque. The band's name refers to the Decembrist revolt, an 1825 insurrection in Imperial Russia. Meloy has stated that the name is also meant to invoke the ""drama and melancholy"" of the month of December.5 Songs, the band's debut extended play, was self-released in 2001. The members at that time played for several hours in a McMenamins hotel the night before to raise the money needed to record in the studio the next day. This originally served as a demo tape and the five songs on it (minus ""Apology Song"") were recorded in under two hours. 

2003-2005: Kill Rock Stars:
After releasing its first full record, Castaways and Cutouts, on Hush Records, the group moved onto the Kill Rock Stars recording label. After the re-release of Castaways, Her Majesty the Decemberists was released in 2003. In 2004, the band released ""The Tain,"" an eighteen-and-a-half minute single track based on the Irish mythological epic Táin Bó Cúailnge. The band's final album with Kill Rock Stars was Picaresque, which was recorded in a former church. 
In March 2005, the band distributed a music video via BitTorrent, the self-produced ""16 Military Wives"" (from Picaresque). In the same month, the band's equipment trailer was stolen; fans contributed to a replacement fund, and another fundraiser was organized via an eBay auction, with buyers bidding for copies of Colin Meloy Sings Morrissey and original artwork by Carson Ellis. The band also received help from Lee Kruger, the Shins, The Dandy Warhols, and other musicians. C.F. Martin & Company offered 6- and 12-string guitars on permanent loan. In early April, police discovered the trailer and a portion of the band's merchandise in Clackamas, Oregon, but the instruments and equipment were not recovered. 

2005-2006: Capitol Records debut and The Crane Wife:
On December 12, 2005, Meloy revealed to Pitchfork Media that the band had signed to Capitol Records, and planned to begin recording their major label debut with producers Tucker Martine and Chris Walla (of Death Cab for Cutie) in April 2006. The band's first album on Capitol, The Crane Wife, was released on October 3, 2006. The release was accompanied by an appearance the same day on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, during which the band performed ""O Valencia!"". The supporting tour (called ""The Rout of the Patagons Tour"") began on October 17, 2006, at Portland, Oregon's Crystal Ballroom. The opening act was Lavender Diamond. Later in the tour, Alasdair Roberts opened for the band. In 2006, The Crane Wife was voted NPR listeners' favorite album of the year, as announced on the December 5 episode of All Songs Considered, and it remains one of the Decemberists' most critically acclaimed records. 
In November 2006, the band encouraged fans to create a music video for the single ""O Valencia!"" using footage of the band in front of a green screen. On his Comedy Central program, Stephen Colbert started a mock feud with the band, claiming his ""green screen challenge"" came first; the band countered that its 2005 on-stage lightsaber fight in San Francisco preceded Colbert's idea. The feud culminated in a December 20 guitar solo competition on Colbert's show, with lead guitarist Funk representing the band. After Colbert feigned a hand injury, Peter Frampton took over for Colbert and won an audience vote. Show guests got involved, with New York Governor-elect Eliot Spitzer and Dr. Henry Kissinger declaring, ""Tonight, I think the American people won."" The prize for winning the challenge was revealed to be a copy of The Crane Wife. According to Meloy, the Colbert challenge was not scripted, though the band was told that Frampton would step in for Colbert. 

2007: ""A Bit of Grass-Stain Does Not a Ruined Pair of Jeans Make"" tour:
In July 2007, the band embarked on a five-date tour with a full orchestral accompaniment. On July 7, the tour put the band on the stage of the historic Hollywood Bowl for the first time, pairing them with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. On July 15, the band performed with The Mann Festival Orchestra at the Mann Center for the Performing Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where they debuted a new song. The band then played a free concert in Chicago at the Millennium Park with the Grant Park Symphony Orchestra. 
On October 6, 2007, the band announced the cancellation of the remainder of their European tour, citing the ill health of a band member. On November 1, 2007, the band further canceled the remaining 28 shows of their ""Long and Short of It"" tour. 

2008: Always the Bridesmaid:
The members of The Decemberists appeared, individually billed (as ""Colin Meloy, Chris Funk, Jenny Conlee, Nate Query, and John Moen""), to perform in support of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama at a rally at the Tom McCall Waterfront Park in Portland, Oregon, on May 18, 2008. On October 14, 2008 the band began releasing a series of singles called Always the Bridesmaid; a volume was released every month until the end of the year. The band also took up a limited tour in support of the singles, including an appearance on Late Night with Conan O'Brien. 

2009: The Hazards of Love:
The Hazards of Love was released on March 24, 2009 on Capitol Records, under Red Light Management (Jason Colton and Ron Laffitte). It was made available for download on iTunes one week earlier, on March 17, 2009. The track ""The Rake's Song"" was put up for download on The Decemberists website in advance of the album's release. During Meloy's 2008 U.S. tour, he played several new songs that were included on the album. The album was produced by Tucker Martine. 
In a post on Rolling Stone's ""Rock 'n' Roll Daily"" blog, the band revealed more details about the album. The original plan was for The Hazards of Love to be a staged musical. However, it seems that the story was ""unstageable"" in such a format. Instead the band played the entire album start to finish at each concert on the spring tour. A press release read: ""The album began when Meloy - long fascinated by the British folk revival of the 1960s - found a copy of revered vocalist Anne Briggs's 1966 EP, titled The Hazards of Love. Since there was no actual song with the album's title, he set out to write one, but was soon immersed in something much larger. The Hazards of Love tells the tale of a woman named Margaret; her shape-shifting lover, William; his fey forest queen mother; and a cold-blooded, lascivious rake, who recounts with spine-chilling ease how he came ""to be living so easy and free"" in ""The Rake's Song"". Lavender Diamond's Becky Stark and My Brightest Diamond's Shara Worden deliver the lead vocals for the female characters, while My Morning Jacket's Jim James, Robyn Hitchcock and The Spinanes' Rebecca Gates appear in supporting roles. The range of sounds reflects the characters' arcs, from the accordion's singsong lilt in ""Isn't it a Lovely Night?"" to the heavy metal thunder of 'The Queen's Rebuke/The Crossing.'"" 
On February 9, 2009, the Decemberists announced in a newsletter to fans that they would be embarking on the first leg of the ""A Short Fazed Hovel"" Tour 2009 starting on May 19 in Los Angeles at the Hollywood Palladium. The newsletter included a complete list of dates for the first leg of the tour ending on June 14 at the Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival in Manchester, Tennessee. On Monday April 27, the band performed a shortened version of ""The Wanting Comes in Waves/Repaid"" on The Colbert Report. 
On August 14, 2009, the Decemberists played in Pittsburgh, PA at the Benedum Center. During the show, the band members performed a skit where they ran up and down the aisles participating in a fictitious battle at Fort Pitt. 
On September 19, 2009, The Decemberists played a ""lottery show"", originally billed as a ""by request"" show, at Terminal 5 in New York City. The setlist was composed of songs drawn from a large bingo turner kept on stage. The master of ceremonies for the evening was singer/songwriter John Wesley Harding and the opening act was Laura Veirs and the Hall of Flames. The randomized setlist included ""July, July!"", ""Yankee Bayonet (I Will Be Home Then)"", ""The Tain I-V"", ""Annan Water"", ""The Crane Wife 3"" and ""The Island/Come and See/The Landlord's Daughter/You'll Not Feel the Drowning"", and an original song, as a bingo ball suggested, called ""Miracle on the Hudson"". 
In 2009, The Decemberists also contributed the song ""Sleepless"" to the AIDS benefit album Dark Was the Night, which was produced by the Red Hot Organization. 
During their European tour in the winter of 2010, the band performed ""The Mariner's Revenge Song"" at the conclusion of each date. The audience was encouraged to scream as if they were being consumed by a whale mentioned in the track's narrative while the band pretended to die on stage. 

2010-2011: The King Is Dead and hiatus:
The Decemberists remained off tour as they embarked on a new studio album. On September 4, 2010, the band opened for Neko Case and the headliner, Bob Dylan, the first day of the Bumbershoot Arts and Music Festival in Seattle, WA. There, they announced that they were wrapping up recording of a new album and debuted three of its tracks. The King Is Dead was released on January 14, 2011, with Peter Buck of R.E.M. contributing instrumentation to three of its songs. Colin Meloy later affirmed that R.E.M. had been an inspiration during the writing and recording of some of the album's material. ""Down by the Water,"" a track from the new album, was released via the band's official site on November 2, and was immediately available on iTunes as a free download. The song would later be nominated for Best Rock Song at the 54th Grammy Awards. The King Is Dead debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in the United States upon its release, the first time a Decemberists album would achieve this. As compared to the band's previous work, which was influenced by the music of the British folk revival, The King Is Dead was more influenced by traditionally American genres including country, blues, and Americana. 
The Decemberists' ""Popes of Pendarvia World Tour"" in support of The King Is Dead began with a show on January 25, 2011 at Beacon Theatre in New York City. The tour, which included engagements throughout the U.S., Canada, and Europe, ended on August 26 at the McMenamins Edgefield in Troutdale, Oregon. During the tour, on May 3, it was announced on The Decemberists' official site that Jenny Conlee had been diagnosed with breast cancer and would miss most of the band's remaining tour dates while receiving treatment and recovering. In support of their bandmate, the band designed a 'Team Jenny' charity t-shirt for the Yellow Bird Project to raise money for Planned Parenthood. Conlee would later make a full recovery after her cancer went into remission. 
Meanwhile, on April 7, 2011, the band released a music video for their song ""This Is Why We Fight"". Directed by Aaron Stewart-Ahn, the video depicts a band of teenagers living in a bleak, post-apocalyptic society. Disgusted with the tyrannical rule of their ""king"", one boy and one girl lead a splinter group away from the camp. Outraged, the king and his forces attack, but the video cuts to black before any resolution can be seen. In August, an eight-song set was released on iTunes featuring six previously released tracks and two new covers: Leonard Cohen's ""Hey, That's No Way To Say Goodbye"" and the Fruit Bats' ""When U Love Somebody."" Later that month, a new music video was debuted for the track entitled ""Calamity Song"". The video depicts a game, played on a tennis court by children, of simulated thermonuclear war as described in the ""Eschaton"" scene of David Foster Wallace's novel Infinite Jest. 
Meloy announced during the ""Popes of Pendarvia"" tour that the group would take a multi-year hiatus once the touring cycle was over. To cap off this period of activity, the band released the follow-up outtake EP Long Live the King on November 1, 2011, as well as a live album from their tour for The King is Dead titled We All Raise Our Voices to the Air (Live Songs 04.11-08.11) on March 13, 2012. In addition, the band recorded a song for The Hunger Games soundtrack, called ""One Engine"". The soundtrack, The Hunger Games: Songs from District 12 and Beyond, was released on March 20, 2012. 
While on hiatus, the group's only activity as The Decemberists was a cameo appearance on the 7th episode in the 24th season of The Simpsons, in which the band was rendered in the show's traditional style of animation and presented as the hip, new music teachers of Springfield Elementary. As well, the episode's theme music was performed with the signature folk flair of The Decemberists. 

2014-2015: What a Terrible World, What a Beautiful World:
During a solo tour in 2013, Meloy announced that the Decemberists would end their hiatus and begin working on a new album within the next year. The hiatus officially concluded on March 5, 2014, with the announcement of two headlining shows at Portland's Crystal Ballroom, the band's first shows in three years, where they played their debut album, Castaways and Cutouts, in its entirety. Additionally, The Decemberists were the mystery band for the 2014 Boston Calling Music Festival, where they played on Saturday, May 24. On April 24, further establishing their return, the band performed on the Season 6 finale of the NBC comedy series Parks and Recreation. 
On November 3, 2014, ""Make You Better"", the band's first single off the new album, was released, and on January 20, 2015, the band's seventh studio album, What a Terrible World, What a Beautiful World, was released. To commemorate both the release of the new album and the Decemberists' success as a whole, January 20th was officially declared ""Decemberists Day"" in the group's hometown of Portland, Oregon by mayor Charlie Hales. 
In support of the album, the band made late-night appearances on Jimmy Kimmel Live! and Conan, and on February 11 embarked on a European tour which included dates in Ireland, the UK, The Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, and Italy. A North American tour began on March 21, 2015 in the band's hometown of Portland, Oregon.

Known for altering his sound with each subsequent release, he incorporates electronic psychedelia, krautrock rhythms, and breakbeat drums and creates a swirling, lush, musical panorama. Snaith also creates more club-oriented dance music under the name Daphni.  Snaith grew up in Dundas, Ontario, Canada, which gave its name to a song from his debut album Start Breaking My Heart. He studied at the University of Toronto as an undergrad, but was based in the UK for several years until he completed his Ph.D. in mathematics at the Imperial College, London in 2005.  Snaith previously recorded under the stage name ""Manitoba"", but changed it under threat of a lawsuit by Handsome ""Dick"" Manitoba, frontman for The Dictators, a punk-rocker with an appetite for litigation. Uninterested in the legal stoush, Snaith is quoted saying that he chose the new moniker ""Caribou"" while on an LSD trip with friends in the Canadian wilderness. He then climbed a tree and didn't come down until he finished his first album under the new moniker, which was four months later.  He has recorded five full lengths: Start Breaking My Heart, a jazzy, ""folktronica"" idm album, Up in Flames, the critically acclaimed shoegazer with analog synths and sometimes live, sometimes sampled drums, The Milk of Human Kindness, his krautrock-inspired album that bleeds 70's prog and 70's drugscapes, the psychedelic pop record, Andorra which landed him the prestigious 2008 Polaris Music Prize on September 29th, 2008 and Swim a disco / dance inspired album created from the idea of making dance music that sounds like being under water. A few years prior to the recording of the album, Snaith's wife gave him swimming lessons as a Christmas present, prompting him to take it up as a new hobby. This partially led to the eventual ideology behind Swim.  His eclectic live performances are renowned, in part for their use of simultaneous drummers and synchronised visuals.  The live band currently consists of Dan Snaith (guitar, keyboards, vocals, drums, flutophone), Ryan Smith (guitar, keyboards), Brad Weber (drums) and John Schmersal (bass, vocals)., ...... .. .. .. ...... ....Swim Remixes.. by ..Caribouband.... ........Sign ..., Canadian electronic musician Daniel Snaith's one-man project was originally called ..., Having already proven himself master of the sublime with his ..., Dan Snaith's early recordings as Manitoba underlined his status among ..., ""rich, strange, endlessly fascinating music: a subtle, beautiful triumph."" —THE ..., Daniel Victor ""Dan"" Snaith (born 1978) is a Canadian composer, musician and recording artist who has performed under the stage names Caribou, Manitoba and Daphni. 

Career:
Snaith originally recorded under the stage name Manitoba, but after being threatened with a lawsuit by Richard ""Handsome Dick"" Manitoba, formerly of punk band The Dictators, Snaith changed his performance name to Caribou. Snaith's previous full-length albums were then re-released under the new moniker, and The Milk of Human Kindness was released in 2005 by Domino. Snaith said that the situation was ""like The Smiths suing John Smith or something"". 
When playing gigs, Snaith usually performs with a live band and plays percussion. Ex-bandmates include bassist Andy Lloyd of Born Ruffians and drummer Peter Mitton, now a producer for CBC radio. Currently, the live band consists of Snaith, Ryan Smith, Brad Weber, and John Schmersal. Live shows also often include complex video projections on a large screen, as captured in a DVD released in November 2005. ""In music I will have an idea to put some different sounds together or a melody that meshes with a chord sequence or a sonic mood,"" said Snaith in an interview. ""I'm not the type of person who takes physical things apart and plays around with them, but I like taking mental ideas apart and playing around with them. That's what appeals to me about what I've spent my life doing."" 
Caribou's 2007 album Andorra won the 2008 Polaris Music Prize, and his DJ-influenced 2010 album Swim was on the 2010 Polaris Music Prize shortlist. In June 2013, Snaith's studio album, Jiaolong, released under the moniker Daphni, was longlisted for the 2013 Polaris Music Prize. 
In December 2011, Caribou curated the All Tomorrow's Parties ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" festival in Minehead, England, alongside co-curators Battles and Les Savy Fav. 
Caribou was awarded Essential Mix of the Year in 2014 by Mixmag for his ""Essential Mix"" on 18 October 2014. 
Caribou's 2014 album Our Love received the IMPALA Album of the Year Award. 

Personal life:

The band comprises bassist/vocalist Troy Sanders, guitarist/vocalist Brent Hinds, guitarist Bill Kelliher and drummer/vocalist Brann Dailor. They have released six full-length albums to date, expanding their musical borders from early raw sludgy riffs to later psychedelic multi-layered songs, yet maintaining progressive style with unusual time signatures and odd instrumentation.  It was announced, in late 2005, that, having fulfilled contractual obligations to indie label, relapse records, Mastodon had been offered a deal by a major music label, a spot on the Warner Music roster. Despite this, however, relapse records released a DVD, and re-released the band's only demo.  An album titled Call of the Mastodon, comprising the material recorded for the band's first and only untitled demo, which featured Eric Saner on vocals, was released in early 2006. A DVD entitled ""The Workhorse Chronicles"" was released not long after and a full length album, the band's Warner Music debut, Blood Mountain, was released September 12th, 2006. In an interview with MTV news, Brann Dailor revealed that the band's sound, on this upcoming release would be decidedly different and more ""progressive."" He also expressed excitement over the possibility of the birth of a new ""prog movement,"" naming bands such as Isis, along with Mastodon, as prospective leaders of said movement.  Blood Mountain met critical acclaim with reviews ranging from Metal Hammer and Kerrang! who stated it was as good or better than their last release Leviathan, while other critics view it as the essential release of the decade and UK Metal Hammer named it best album of '06. Blood Mountain also featured guest appearances by Scott Kelly of Neurosis on the track ""Crystal Skull"", Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age on ""Colony of Birchmen"", as well as The Mars Volta's keyboardist Isaiah ""Ikey"" Owens on ""Pendulous Skin"" and singer Cedric Bixler-Zavala on ""Siberian Divide"".  Mastodon's fourth album Crack the Skye was released on March 24, 2009 as a normal version and a deluxe version (which includes all songs in instrumental versions as well as their normal versions). The album is produced by Brendan O'Brien, and Scott Kelly of Neurosis returns as a guest musician on the title-track. The band had debuted three new tracks at the Bonnaroo Music Festival, but did not play anymore live before the album's release, due to fears of internet distribution and wanting to play the songs to the right audience. In a MusicRadar interview, guitarist Bill Kelliher confirmed that the album is about an ""out of body experience,"" and looks at the concepts of astral travel, wormholes, Stephen Hawking's theories and the spiritual realm. Drummer Brann Dailor has a section of vocals on the song ""Oblivion"" following the intro and chorus. The band has announced that they will play the album in its entirety incorporating a stage show on their upcoming tour. Mastodon was a headliner at the Scion Rock Fest on February 28, 2009, performing a set containing three tracks from Crack The Skye, the first time these songs were played since being finalized and recorded. Scott Kelly made an appearance performing his guest vocals for the songs ""Crack the Skye,"" ""Aqua Dementia,"" and ""Crystal Skull.""  Mastodon's fifth album The Hunter was released on September 26, 2011 in the UK and one day later in the US via Reprise Records. The Hunter Songfacts says that the album was titled in honor of guitarist/vocalist Brent Hinds' brother, Brad, who unexpectedly passed away while hunting in December 2010. Mastodon actually had two working titles for the album in honor of Brad: ""The Hunter"" or ""Brother.""  Mastodon have previously appeared on the second stage at Ozzfest 2005 and have toured with the likes of Slayer, Lamb of God and Children of Bodom on the Unholy Alliance US tour and have 3 songs recorded live on the accompanying tour DVD.

History:

Formation, early years and Remission (2000-2003):
Mastodon was formed on January 13, 2000 after drummer Brann Dailor and guitarist Bill Kelliher moved to Atlanta from Victor, New York and met bassist/singer Troy Sanders and guitarist/singer Brent Hinds at a High on Fire show. They discovered they had a mutual appreciation of sludge metal bands Melvins and Neurosis and '70s hard-rockers Thin Lizzy, and shortly thereafter formed Mastodon. In an interview in 2009, Kelliher revealed that the first time Hinds attended a practice with the band, he ""showed up so wasted he couldn't play"". 
The band recorded a demo in 2000, which featured the band's first lead singer, Eric Saner on vocals. Saner left the band for personal reasons after just a couple of months. After recording a four song demo and a 7-inch picture disc through Reptilian Records, Mastodon landed a record deal with Relapse Records in 2001. They released an EP, Lifesblood, in 2001, and their first full-length album, Remission, was released in 2002, with the singles ""March of the Fire Ants"" and ""Crusher/Destroyer"" (which was also featured on Tony Hawk's Underground).

Leviathan was followed by the 2006 release of Call of the Mastodon, a remastered collection of the band's first nine songs, and a DVD of interviews and concert footage called The Workhorse Chronicles that includes material from the band's early days as a five-piece. The band has stated that ""Call of the Mastodon"" is their third studio album even though the album is a compilation album.

After the televised performance, member Brent Hinds was reported to have sustained a severe head injury. Blabbermouth.net initially reported that it was the result of a brutal assault but the police report later suggested that an inebriated Hinds had started a fight with System of a Down bassist Shavo Odadjian and vocalist William Hudson, also known as Reverend William Burke of Achozen. 
""Sleeping Giant"" was made available as a downloadable song for Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock, ""Colony of Birchmen"" was included on Harmonix's Rock Band 2 and also volition's Saints row 2, and ""Divinations"" was featured in Madden NFL 10 and Saints Row: The Third.

Crack the Skye and Live at the Aragon (2009-2010):

Crack the Skye was released on March 24, 2009, as a normal version and a deluxe version (which includes all songs in instrumental versions as well as their normal versions) and entered the Billboard 200 at number 11 a week later. The album is produced by Brendan O'Brien and Scott Kelly of Neurosis returns as a guest musician on the title-track. In a MusicRadar interview, guitarist Bill Kelliher confirmed the album is about an ""out-of-body experience"", and looks at the concepts of astral travel, wormholes, Stephen Hawking's theories and the spiritual realm. The album follows a quadriplegic who learns astral projection. On his journey he flies too close to the sun, burning his umbilical cord which connects him to his body, and flies into oblivion. At the same time in Czarist Russia, Rasputin and his cult were channeling spirits and brought the quadriplegic to their time. He explains his situation and foretells the assassination of Rasputin. Inevitably Rasputin is assassinated and Rasputin guides him back to his body. The band had debuted three new tracks at the Bonnaroo Music Festival, but did not play any more live shows before the album's release, due to fears of internet distribution and wanting to play the songs to the right audience. Drummer Brann Dailor sings lead vocals for the verses of the song ""Oblivion."" Mastodon was a headliner at the Scion Rock Fest on February 28, 2009, performing a set containing three tracks from Crack the Skye, the first time these songs were played since being finalized and recorded. On May 15, 2009, Mastodon performed a shortened version of ""Oblivion"" on the Late Show with David Letterman.

Film director Jimmy Hayward contacted the band during their 2009 tour of Europe and expressed how much listening to Blood Mountain had helped his creative process while finishing a screenplay, and he offered Mastodon a chance to score the film he had been working on - Jonah Hex. In an interview with Paste magazine, bassist Troy Sanders said that Hayward ""called us out of the blue as a fan. It was the most beautiful, authentic way to collaborate."" Mastodon used scenes from the film as inspiration during the writing and recording process, and the instrumental soundtrack, Jonah Hex: Revenge Gets Ugly EP, was released on June 29, 2010, through Reprise Records.

Characteristics:

Musical style:

Mastodon cross multiple heavy metal genres such as progressive metal,sludge metal,experimental metal,stoner metal,alternative metal and groove metal. James Christopher Monger of Allmusic describes Mastodon as ""one of the more notable New Wave of American Heavy Metal acts, a genre spawned in the mid-'90s by bands like Pantera, Biohazard, and Machine Head, Mastodon's innovative, lyrically astute blend of progressive metal, grindcore, and hardcore helped position the band as one of the preeminent metal acts of the early 21st century."" 
Bassist Troy Sanders stated about their musical style: 
"" 
We don't consider ourselves a metal band. We recognize there is a lot of metal in us, but we also want to believe we have a lot of rock 'n' roll in us, and we have a lot of progressive rock in us, we have bits and pieces of thrash and punk, and psychedelic-ness sprinkled throughout. A lot of times for me personally, just having the metal tag itself seems kind of limiting on us because we have such an appreciation for all styles of music and we like to incorporate bits and pieces of those into our songs. But we also recognize all the different subgenres and the millions of times people say, ""Oh, what do they sound like?"" and you say something, I understand that. But, it doesn't affect how we create anything at all. 
"" 
 Scott Kelly of Neurosis has performed vocals on every Mastodon album excluding Remission. 
Mastodon's musical style has evolved much from their earliest pre-Remission releases to The Hunter. Their early work is significantly heavier and more abrasive than their later work, primarily or exclusively using harsh vocals, more distorted instruments, and more atypical song structures; this is especially prominent in their earliest work. The release of Mastodon's third studio album Blood Mountain, which incorporates both clean and harsh vocals, marked a shift in the vocal styles used, with subsequent albums favouring clean vocals almost exclusively. 

Lyrical themes:
Over its first four albums, Mastodon had specific concepts in mind, specifically the classical elements of fire, water, earth, and air.Remission does not deal with a particular theme but it is loosely based on the theme of fire. Songs like ""Crusher Destroyer"", ""Where Strides the Behemoth"" and ""Ol'e Nessie"" deal with the theme of fictional creatures. 
Leviathan is about the novel Moby-Dick. It centers around the main characters and their thoughts during the story. 
Blood Mountain is about a man who is searching for the ""Crystal Skull"", which is on top of the ""Blood Mountain"". According to bassist Troy Sanders, ""It's about climbing up a mountain and the different things that can happen to you when you're stranded on a mountain, in the woods, and you're lost. You're starving, hallucinating, running into strange creatures. You're being hunted. It's about that whole struggle."" 
Crack the Skye deals with many different themes. The title is a tribute to ""Skye"", the little sister of drummer Brann Dailor, who committed suicide at the age of fourteen. Themes touched on within the album include ""dark magic(k), astral travelling and the role of Rasputin in the downfall of Czarist Russia"". 
The Hunter does not deal with an entire concept like their earlier work, but is remarked by the band to have an attachment to the Chinese classical element of wood. Songs such as ""Spectrelight"" or ""Black Tongue"" seem to have no meaning related to this theme, although the former seems to have themes of redemption and trusting oneself while the latter focuses on pain and betrayal. Meanwhile, songs such as ""Dry Bone Valley"" (especially) and ""Octopus Has No Friends"" are seemingly cut from a concept album. The title is a tribute to Hinds's brother, Brad Hinds, who died of a heart attack on December 4, 2010 while out hunting. 

Visual art:

Artwork:

Artist Paul Romano was responsible for all of the band's album art and backdrops up to 2011. The artwork for the band's 5th studio album The Hunter was made by AJ Fosik, a wood carver who was also responsible for the backdrop the band used live at the time. Oakland-based artist Skinner, who, in his own words, specializes in ""psychedelic nightmare paintings"", has taken the reins on Once More 'Round the Sun. ""It's going to be a work of art for sure. It's going to be very eye-opening"", said bassist Troy Sanders before the album's released. ""Very striking. It's from another dimension, and a lot of our music is geared toward that idea--taking you to another planet on songs. It's out there, and I think it's incredible."" 

Live presentation:
Following their first tours in the early 2000s, Mastodon have performed at many major festivals such as Download, Roskilde, Coachella, Bonnaroo, Big Day Out, Rock Werchter, Pinkpop, Metaltown, Ottawa Bluesfest, Sonisphere and Soundwave. When performing the band has traditionally had a fairly lo-fi visual presentation. However, during the band's ""Crack The Skye Tour"" (2009-2010), they used a large screen behind the drumkit showing a visual show. 

Legacy and reception:
The ""sludge/stoner/alternative metal outfit"" Mastodon, as labelled by Allmusic, is ""one of the preeminent metal acts of the early 21st century"". The BBC stated about Mastodon: ""They might be bonkers of lyric, full of fantasy mumbo jumbo, but the band is unashamedly committed to its complex-of-composition craft, and the results have frequently stunned ever since their 2002 debut, Remission. They are the most ambitious, most fearless, most fun heavy metal band to have breached the mainstream since the genre oozed its way out of The Midlands in the 1970s.""Alternative Press has stated: ""Mastodon are one of the all-time great hard-rock groups.""Rolling Stone stated: ""Mastodon are the greatest metal band of their generation -- no one else comes close.""

The band is best known for their reverb-soaked sound and their enthusiastic live shows. My Morning Jacket is signed with ATO Records. The band's style is a blend of alternative, alt country, folk rock and psychedelic rock.

History:

My Morning Jacket was formed in 1998 in Louisville, Kentucky by singer, songwriter and guitarist Jim James (real name: James Olliges Jr). The original line-up also included three members of the Shelbyville emo-punk band Winter Death Club; namely John McQuade (later known as Johnny Quaid - guitar and vocals), Tom Blankenship (later known as Two Tone Tommy - bass) and J. Roberts (later known as J. Glenn - drums). Winter Death Club were signed to Charleston indie label Street Records in 1997 by Tas Taiganides after he booked them and Jim James (performing as ""Month of Sundays"") for a ""Punk Rock Matinees"" show at the Horse & Cart Cafe. Winter Death Club released a 7"" split single with Eurogression on Street Records. Jim James was also offered a record deal, but he declined the offer, disbanded Month of Sundays and formed a new band with Quaid, Blankenship and Glenn. The band was named My Morning Jacket and subsequently signed to Darla Records. 
The band's debut album, The Tennessee Fire, was released in May 1999. The following year, keyboardist Danny Cash was added to the line up. A second album, At Dawn, followed. It again featured drummer J. Glenn, but he had already left the band by the time it was released in 2001. Glenn was replaced by Chris 'KC' Guetig, although he was replaced by James' childhood friend Patrick Hallahan in May 2002. 
My Morning Jacket signed with ATO Records in 2002. In 2003, they released It Still Moves, their major-label debut. This was followed by a live EP Acoustic Citsuoca, which was notable for the absence of reverb on Jim James' vocals and thus sounded very different from their earlier works. 
In January 2004, Quaid and Cash left the band and were replaced by Carl Broemel and Bo Koster respectively. In November 2004, the band released two collections of early work, which included demos, live recordings, and cover versions. These discs are entitled Early Recordings Chapter 1 - The Sandworm Cometh and Early Recordings Chapter 2 - Learning. 
October 2005 saw the release of the critically acclaimed album Z, released by Sony BMG. The band was featured (under the name Ruckus) in the 2005 film Elizabethtown. They contributed an original song ""Where to Begin"" and ""Same In Any Language"" written by Nancy Wilson of Heart. 
In 2006, My Morning Jacket were musical guests on the Late Show with David Letterman, performing with members of the Boston Pops, with whom they played two shows at Boston Symphony Hall later in the month. In 2006 the band also released a live double album and DVD entitled Okonokos. 
In 2007, the band opened for Pearl Jam at Lollapalooza in August, and recorded their album Evil Urges, which was released on June 10, 2008. Prior to its release, they performed at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April, and at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in June. It was followed by a June 20 show at Radio City Music Hall. 

Their 2008 Bonnaroo set lasted almost four hours, starting at midnight on Friday; it featured guest appearances by Kirk Hammett of Metallica, comedian Zach Galifianakis and the Nashville-Louisville horns. Unfazed by a torrential downpour for much of its first half, the band's set went on to feature thirty five songs, including all but two tracks from Evil Urges and several covers, such as Erykah Badu's ""Tyrone"", Kool and the Gang's ""Get Down on It"", Sly and the Family Stone's ""Hot Fun in the Summertime"", James Brown's ""Cold Sweat"", Bobby Womack's ""Across 110th Street"", Funkadelic's ""Hit It and Quit It"", Velvet Underground's ""Oh! Sweet Nuthin"" and Mötley Crüe's ""Home Sweet Home"". 
On May 10, 2008, they were the musical guest on Saturday Night Live and played ""Evil Urges"" and ""I'm Amazed"". In August 2008, an animated music video for the song ""Touch Me I'm Going to Scream Part 2"" was released. The video was created by the graphics design team Hornet's Mixtape Club. The Autumn 2008 European Tour had to be canceled after Jim James was injured in a fall from the stage in Iowa City, Iowa. Evil Urges was nominated for a Grammy for Best Alternative rock Album 
The band was featured on CNN's 2009 New Year's Eve show with Anderson Cooper and Kathy Griffin, performing from Madison Square Garden. The band supported Neil Young on his Australian tour and played the Big Day Out festival. Celebración de la Ciudad Natal, released on Record Store Day, April 18, 2009, is an eight song EP taken from two live recordings, notably the band's Summer 2008 Waterfront Park concert in their hometown of Louisville, KY. In May 2009 Open Salon rock critic MJ Wycha called My Morning Jacket ""the best thing to happen to rock music in years."" 
The entire band appeared as themselves in the American Dad episode, ""My Morning Straitjacket"", which aired on November 22, 2009. The episode featured the single Touch Me I'm Going To Scream Part 2 in a psychedelic music video experienced by Stan Smith. Stan then enjoys I'm Amazed and changes his doorbell to an excerpt of Phone Went West. Remnants plays as Francine gets Stan backstage to meet Jim James in person. The episode ends with a live performance of Wordless Chorus. 
At one point, there were plans for My Morning Jacket to tour as The Electric Mayhem, the fictional band from the puppet series The Muppet Show. The band would have performed live backstage, while animatronic versions of the puppet characters appeared on stage. However, The Walt Disney Company, who own the rights to The Muppets, abandoned this project. 
In 2010, My Morning Jacket took up residency at New York's Terminal 5 on October 18, 19, 21, 22 and 23, performing one of their five studio releases each night along with additional material from the relevant period. According to the September 16, 2010 issue of Rolling Stone, My Morning Jacket has started working on their next LP. ""We've got five songs done,"" says front man Jim James. ""It'll probably be out next spring."" James is co-producing the record with The Decemberists collaborator Tucker Martine in an old church in My Morning Jacket's hometown of Louisville, Kentucky. ""We're trying to do everything but the strings live,"" says James. ""There's something old and dirty-sounding about it."" Their sixth album Circuital was released on May 31, 2011. On October 12, 2010, My Morning Jacket performed on Late Show with David Letterman. The performance was webcast live on CBS.com. The band also played Late Night with Jimmy Fallon along with The Roots on October 13, 2010. They also appeared on VH1's Storytellers on June 3, 2011. 
In 2013 it was announced that the band would be hosting and performing at their own One Big Holiday all-inclusive music festival at the Hard Rock Hotel Rivera Maya in Puerto Aventuras, Mexico. Along with the band, The Flaming Lips, The Preservation Hall Jazz Band and Mariachi El Bronx would round out the four night event that took place January 26-30, 2014. In 2015 the second One Big Holiday festival took place at the same resort between January 31-February 4. The second festival featured Band of Horses, Dr. Dog, The War on Drugs, Dawes, Sylvan Esso and Biz Markie. 
In early 2015, it was announced that the band would headline the Boston Calling Music Festival in May 2015. On March 3, 2015 the band's seventh album The Waterfall was announced, with a release date set for May 5, 2015. The first song available from this release is called Big Decisions.

The last lineup consisted of Thurston Moore (vocals,  guitar), Kim Gordon (vocals, bass, guitar), Lee Ranaldo (vocals and guitar), Steve Shelley (drums) and Mark Ibold (bass).  In their early career, Sonic Youth was associated with the no wave art and music scene in New York City. Part of the first wave of American noise rock groups, the band carried out their interpretation of the hardcore punk ethos throughout the evolving American underground that focused more on the DIY ethic of the genre rather than its specific sound. As a result, Sonic Youth was pivotal in the rise of the alternative rock movement.  Sonic Youth have expressed a wide variety of influences, ranging from the influential protopunk musician Patti Smith to composer John Cage. The band has been praised for having ""redefined what rock guitar could do"", using a wide variety of unorthodox guitar tunings, and preparing guitars with objects like drumsticks and screwdrivers to alter the instruments' timbre.  Formation and early history: 1977-1981  Sonic Youth's history began when guitarist Thurston Moore moved to New York City in early 1976. Interested in punk, Moore joined The Coachmen, a guitar-based quartet, after arriving in the city. Lee Ranaldo, an art student at Binghamton University, became a fan of the Coachmen, and he and Moore were soon friends. Ranaldo was a member of Glenn Branca's electric guitar ensemble, touring throughout the United States and Europe. After the breakup of the Coachmen, Moore began jamming with Stanton Miranda, whose band, ckm, featured local artist Kim Gordon.  Moore and Gordon formed a band, appearing under names like Male Bonding and Red Milk before agreeing upon The Arcadians in late 1980. The band played their first show at Noise Fest in June 1981 at New York's White Columns gallery. Branca's ensemble played at the festival. Their performance impressed Moore, who described them as ""the most ferocious guitar band that I had ever seen in my life."" After Branca's set, Moore asked Ranaldo if he wanted to join the Arcadians. Ranaldo accepted; the band played three songs at the festival later in the week without a drummer. Each band member took turns playing the drums, until they met drummer Richard Edson.  Moore soon renamed the band ""Sonic Youth"". The name came from combining the nickname of MC5's Fred ""Sonic"" Smith with the trend of reggae artists, such as Big Youth, featuring the word ""Youth"" in their names. Gordon later recalled that ""as soon as Thurston came up with the name Sonic Youth, a certain sound that was more of what we wanted to do came about.""   Early releases: 1982-1985  Branca signed Sonic Youth as the first act on his record label Neutral Records. In December 1981 the group recorded five songs in a studio in New York's Radio City Music Hall. The material was a released as the Sonic Youth mini-LP that, while largely ignored, was sent to a few key members of the US press that gave it uniformly favorable reviews. After their first record, Edson quit the group for a modestly successful acting career and was replaced by Bob Bert.  During their early days as part of the New York music scene, Sonic Youth formed a friendship with noisy New Yorkers Swans. The bands came to share the same rehearsal space, and Sonic Youth embarked on its first tour, a two-week journey through the southern United States starting in November 1982, supporting Swans. During a second tour with Swans of the Midwest the following month, tensions ran high and Moore constantly criticized Bert's drumming, which he felt wasn't ""in the pocket"". Bert was fired afterwards and replaced by Jim Sclavunos, who played drums on the band's 1983 album Confusion Is Sex. Sonic Youth set up a two-week tour of Europe for the summer of 1983. Sclavunos, however, quit after only a few months. The group asked Bert to rejoin, and he agreed, on the condition that he would not be fired again after the tour's conclusion.  Sonic Youth found themselves well-received in Europe, but the New York press largely ignored the local noise rock scene. Eventually, as the press began to take notice of the genre, Sonic Youth was grouped along with bands like Big Black, The Butthole Surfers and Pussy Galore under the ""pigfuck"" label by Village Voice music critic Robert Christgau. (Christgau saw these bands as sharing an abrasive, noisy and confrontational aesthetic.) Based on this classification, and on a negative live review by Christgau, a feud developed between Moore and the critic, with Moore renaming the song ""Kill Yr Idols"" to ""I Killed Christgau With My Big Fucking Dick"" before the two sorted out their differences amicably.  During another tour of Europe in 1984, Sonic Youth's disastrous London debut (where the band's equipment malfunctioned and Moore consequently destroyed the equipment onstage in frustration) actually resulted in rave reviews in Sounds and the NME. By the time they returned to New York, they were so popular they played shows practically every week. That same year Moore and Gordon were married and Sonic Youth released Bad Moon Rising, a self-described ""Americana"" album that served as a reaction to the state of the nation at the time. The album, recorded by Martin Bisi, was built around transitional pieces that Moore and Ranaldo had come up with in order to take up time onstage while the other guitarist was busy tuning his instrument; as a result there are almost no breaks between the songs on the record, which feature walls of feedback and pounding rhythms. Bad Moon Rising featured an appearance by Lydia Lunch on the album's single ""Death Valley '69"", inspired by the Charles Manson Family murders. In contrast to their abrasive, atonal material of the time, the band considered the song relatively conventional. Due to a falling-out with Branca over disputed royalty payments from their Neutral releases, they were signed to Homestead Records by Gerard Cosloy and by Blast First in the UK (which founder Paul Smith created simply so he could distribute the band's records in Europe). While even the New York press ignored Bad Moon Rising upon its release, now viewing the band as too arty and pretentious, Sonic Youth was becoming quite critically acclaimed in the United Kingdom, where the new album had sold 5,000 copies in just six months.  Claiming he was bored with playing Bad Moon Rising live in its entirety for over a year, Bert quit the group and was replaced by Steve Shelley, formerly of the hardcore group Crucifucks. The band was so impressed with Shelley's drumming after seeing him play live they hired him without an audition. Bert has remained on good terms with the group; he and Shelley both appeared in the music video for ""Death Valley '69"", as Bert performed the drums on the song, but Shelley was the group's drummer when the video was made.   SST and Enigma: 1986-1989  Sonic Youth had a long fascination with influential indie label Sst Records. Ranaldo said, ""It was the first record company we were on that we really would have given anything to be on."" Sonic Youth eventually signed to the label in early 1986 and began recording Evol with Martin Bisi in March of that year.  Evol itself represented an evolution of sorts for the band: in addition to increasingly melodic material and the impact of new drummer Shelley's playing, the record also dealt with themes of celebrity, particularly with songs like ""Expressway To Yr Skull"" (called ""a classic"" by Neil Young) and ""Marilyn Moore"". Signing to SST catapulted the band on to a national stage, something that did not happen to their peers in the New York underground. The mainstream music press subsequently began to take notice of the band. Robert Palmer of the The New York Times declared that Sonic Youth was ""making the most startlingly original guitar-based music since Jimi Hendrix"" and even People praised Evol as the ""aural equivalent of a toxic waste dump."" Evol is also notable for a guest appearance by bass guitarist Mike Watt, a friend whom the band coaxed to come to New York after he was deeply depressed by the death of his bandmate, D. Boon.  On 1987's Sister, Sonic Youth continued refining their blend of pop song structures with uncompromising experimentalism. Another loose concept album, Sister is partly inspired by the life and works of science fiction writer Philip K. Dick (the ""sister"" of the title was Dick's fraternal twin, who died shortly after her birth, and whose memory haunted Dick his entire life). Sister sold 60,000 copies and received very positive reviews, becoming the first Sonic Youth album to crack the Top 20 of the Village Voice's Pazz & Jop critics poll.  Despite the critical success, the band was becoming increasingly dissatisfied with SST due to concerns about payment and other administrative practices. Sonic Youth decided to release their next record on Enigma Records, which was distributed by Capitol Records and partly owned by EMI. The 1988 double LP Daydream Nation was a critical success that earned Sonic Youth substantial acclaim. The album came in second on the Village Voice Pazz & Jop poll and topped the year-end album lists of the NME, CMJ, and Melody Maker. In 2006, it was one of 50 recordings chosen that year by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry. The lead single from the album, ""Teen Age Riot"", was the first song from the band to reach significant success, receiving heavy airplay in modern and college rock stations. A number of prominent music periodicals including Rolling Stone hailed Daydream Nation as one of the best albums of the decade and named Sonic Youth as the ""Hot Band"" in its ""Hot"" issue. Unfortunately, distribution problems arose and Daydream Nation was often difficult to find in stores. Moore considered Enigma a ""cheap-jack Mafioso outfit"" and the band began looking for a major label deal.   Major label career and alternative icons: 1990-1999  In 1990, Sonic Youth released Goo (their first album for Geffen), which featured the single ""Kool Thing"" on which Chuck D from rap group Public Enemy guested. ""Kool Thing"" became the song that many casual music fans associate with the band; it was later featured in the video game Guitar Hero III and was made available as a paid download for the Rock Band video game. The record is considered much more accessible than their previous work. Their 1991 tour with the then relatively unknown Nirvana was captured in the film 1991: The Year Punk Broke.  In 1992, the band released Dirty on the DGC label. Their influence as tastemakers continued with their discovery of acclaimed skateboard video director Spike Jonze, who they recruited for the video for ""100%"", which also featured skateboarder turned actor Jason Lee. This song, along with the Gordon tune ""JC"" contain lyrical references to the murder of Joe Cole, a friend who worked with the band as a roadie. The album features artwork by Los Angeles-based artist Mike Kelley. In addition, Robert Bradley's Blackwater Surprise opened on numerous occasions for Sonic Youth in the late 90s. ""Dirty"" features a guest appearance by Ian McKaye (Minor Threat and Fugazi) playing guitar on the track ""Youth Against Fascism"".  In 1994 the band released Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star, their best charting release in the United States, which peaked at #34 on the Billboard 200. The album was filled with low-key melodies and even produced a hit single, ""Bull in the Heather"". Moore and Gordon's daughter, Coco Hayley Gordon Moore was born earlier in the year, and many of the songs from the album were never played live because there was never a full tour to support the album due to Gordon's pregnancy.  The band headlined the 1995 Lollapalooza festival. By that time, alternative rock had gained considerable mainstream attention, and the festival was parodied on The Simpsons 1996 episode ""Homerpalooza"", which featured voiceovers from the band. They also performed the final credits theme for that episode.  Gordon collaborated in Free Kitten, and started a clothing label X-Girl, based in Los Angeles. Ranaldo and Moore have played with many experimental / noise musicians, including William Hooker, Nels Cline, Tom Surgal, Don Dietrich, Christian Marclay and Mission of Burma, among others. Shelley runs the Smells Like Records record label, as well as playing in backing bands for Chan Marshall (Cat Power) and Two Dollar Guitar.  From Sonic Youth's earliest days, Gordon had occasionally played guitar with the group. About the time of A Thousand Leaves and Washing Machine she began playing guitar more frequently, resulting in a three-guitar and drums lineup. These songs were something of a shift for the group's sound, and would lead to the introduction of a fifth member a few years later.  The Washing Machine album started a major shift in the band, away from their punk roots, that working with longer noise-jam sections and included two tracks that showed the new approach in full force - the title track ""Washing Machine"", which is just under 10 minutes long, and ""The Diamond Sea"", which is over 19 minutes long.  During the late 1990s and early 2000s, the band began releasing a series of highly experimental records on their own Hoboken, New Jersey-based label SYR. The music was mostly instrumental, and the album and track titles and even the liner notes and credits were in different languages: SYR1 was in French, SYR2 in Dutch, SYR3 in Esperanto, SYR5 in Japanese, SYR6 in Lithuanian, SYR7 in Arpitan, and SYR8 in Danish. SYR3 was the first to feature Jim O'Rourke, who went on to become an official band member.  SYR4 was subtitled ""Goodbye, 20th Century"" and featured works by avant-garde classical composers such as John Cage, Yoko Ono, Steve Reich, and Christian Wolff played by Sonic Youth along with several collaborators from the modern avant-garde music scene, such as Christian Marclay, William Winant, Wharton Tiers, Takehisa Kosugi and others. The album received mixed reviews, but some critics praised the group's efforts at popularizing and reinterpreting the composers' works.   Later DGC period: 2000-2006  On July 4, 1999, Sonic Youth's instruments, amps, and gear were stolen in the middle of the night while on tour in Orange, California (see initial post on Usenet). Forced to start from scratch with new instruments, they recorded NYC Ghosts & Flowers and opened for Pearl Jam during the east coast leg of their 2000 tour.  In 2001 Sonic Youth collaborated with French avant-garde singer and poet Brigitte Fontaine in Fontaine's album ""Kékéland"".  When the September 11, 2001 attacks occurred, several members of the band were blocks away, Jim at their NYC studio (Echo Canyon on Murray Street), and Ranaldo and his wife Leah nearby at home. After the attacks, they curated the first U.S. outing of the All Tomorrow's Parties music festival in L.A. The festival was originally scheduled for October 2001, but it was delayed until March the following year due to the attacks.  In the summer of 2002, Murray Street was released; many critics heralded a ""return to form for SY"", seemingly revitalized by the addition of Jim O'Rourke, who became a full member during this period, playing bass guitar, guitar, and occasionally synthesizer. This was followed in 2004 by the release of Sonic Nurse, an album similar in sound and approach to its immediate predecessor that also received positive reviews. ""Pattern Recognition"", a song named after the 2003 William Gibson novel, finds the band once again using Gibson's work for inspiration. The band also showed their pop culture commentary and sense of humor with the track ""Mariah Carey and the Arthur Doyle Hand Cream"", a faster-tempo song sung by Gordon, which spoofed Carey's life, including her short-lived relationship with rapper Eminem, which originally appeared on a 2003 split 7"" with Erase Errata (on the album cover, the reference to ""Mariah Carey"" in the title was replaced by ""Kim Gordon"" due to potential copyright issues. Sonic Nurse had decent sales, in part due to performances on TV talk shows including Late Night with Conan O'Brien and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. The band was also slated to perform in 2004's Lollapalooza tour along with acts such as The Pixies and The Flaming Lips, but the concert was canceled due to lackluster ticket sales. When the band toured later that year, they played extensively from their 1980s catalog.  On October 6, 2005, Los Angeles CityBeat reported that some of the gear stolen in 1999 was surprisingly recovered and that it might be used for recording of the next album, then tentatively titled Sonic Life. The report also said that Jim O'Rourke might be leaving the band soon; his departure was confirmed by Lee Ranaldo in an interview to Pitchfork Media. In May 2006, the group announced on their website that ex-Pavement member Mark Ibold would play bass for the band on their upcoming tour.  Rather Ripped was released in Europe on June 5, 2006 and in the USA on June 13, 2006. Compared to previous Sonic Youth recordings, the album features many short, conventionally structured, melodic songs and fewer feedback-fuelled left field improvisations (the band's avant-garde tendencies nowadays have been largely exorcised through SYR releases and solo outings rather than band albums). Later that summer, Sonic Youth played the 2006 Bonnaroo Festival, as well as Lollapalooza, promoting the album. In December, Rolling Stone made it their number three Album of the Year 2006.  The band released The Destroyed Room: B-Sides and Rarities in December 2006. It features tracks previously available only on vinyl, limited-release compilations, b-sides to international singles, and some material that had never before been released. This marked the band's final Geffen release.   Independent agents and signing to Matador: 2007-present  In 2008 the band independently re-released Master-Dik for the first time on CD in March exclusively at their online store. They also released two more editions to the SYR, SYR7: J'Accuse Ted Hughes, and SYR8: Andre Sider Af Sonic Youth. SYR7 was released on April 22, and SYR8 was released July 28. On June 10, they also released a compilation album on Starbucks Music, called Hits Are for Squares. The first 15 tracks were selected by other celebrities, and track 16, ""Slow Revolution"", is a new recording by Sonic Youth.  Also in June, the band was the subject of an intensively researched biography, Goodbye 20th Century: A Biography of Sonic Youth written by music journalist David Browne. The book was cited as ""compelling"" (Salon), ""compulsively readable"" (Publishers Weekly), and ""an expressway to the soul of the influential band"" (Vanity Fair). The book featured new interviews with the band as well as nearly 100 friends, family members, and peers. It was published by Da Capo and included over 60 rare photos.  On August 30 2008, the band premiered two new songs at the final McCarren Park Pool show. Thurston Moore stated that in November 2008 the band will start recording a new studio album. The band did not continue their contract with Geffen, being discontent at the way Geffen handled their last four or five albums. On September 8, 2008, it was confirmed by Matador's Matablog that Sonic Youth will release its sixteenth album (titled The Eternal) in spring, 2009, on Matador Records. In December 2008 it was also announced that the group had recently collaborated with John Paul Jones (of Led Zeppelin fame) on a piece that served as the soundtrack for a new Merce Cunningham Dance Company piece. This work was performed by the company on April 16-19, 2009, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in celebration of Cunningham's 90th birthday. On February 12, the band revealed the cover art for The Eternal via their website and blog. The album, produced by John Agnello, was released on June 9, 2009. With the release Matador Records also offered an exclusive live LP only available to those who preordered the album.  On October 14, 2011, Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore announced that they separated after 27 years of marriage through a statement by Matador. The announcement has raised doubts over the future of Sonic Youth after Matador revealed that plans for the band remained ""uncertain,"" despite the fact the band had previously hinted they would record new material later in the year  In a interview on November 28, 2011, Lee Ranaldo said that Sonic Youth are ""ending for a while"". ""I'm feeling optimistic about the future no matter what happens at this point,"" Ranaldo said. ""It was a pretty good tour overall. I mean, there was a little bit of tiptoeing around and some different situations with the travelling - you know, they're not sharing a room any more or anything like that ... It remains to be seen at this point what happens. I think they are certainly the last shows for a while and I guess I'd just leave it at that."" Ranaldo also suggest there are no plans for Sonic Youth to record new material. ""There's tons and tons of archival projects and things like that still going on,"" he said. ""I'm just happy right now to let the future take its course.""  Musical style and influences:  Alternative tunings  Sonic Youth's sound relies heavily on the use of alternative tunings. Scordatura on stringed instruments has been used for centuries and alternative guitar tunings had been used for decades in blues music, and to a limited degree in rock music (such as with Lou Reed's Ostrich guitar on The Velvet Underground & Nico), but Sonic Youth began using a variety of tunings more radical than nearly anything in rock music history. The tunings were painstakingly developed by Moore and Ranaldo during the band's rehearsals; Moore once reported that the odd tunings were an attempt to introduce new sounds: ""When you're playing in standard tuning all the time ... things sound pretty standard."" Rather than re-tune for every song, Sonic Youth generally use a particular guitar for one or two songs, and can take dozens of instruments on tour. This can be the source of much trouble for the band, as some songs rely on specific guitars that have been uniquely prepared.  Influences  Besides Branca, French avant-gardist Brigitte Fontaine, Patti Smith, Public Image Ltd (PiL) and The Stooges, another influence was 1980s-era hardcore punk; after seeing Minor Threat perform in May 1982, Moore declared them ""the greatest live band I have ever seen"". While recognizing that their own music was very different from hardcore, Moore and Gordon, especially, were impressed by hardcore's speed and intensity, and by the nationwide network of musicians and fans. ""It was great,"" said Moore, ""the whole thing with slam dancing and stage diving, that was far more exciting than pogoing and spitting... I thought hardcore was very musical and very radical.""  Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo have expressed on numerous occasions their admiration for the music of Joni Mitchell, such as this quote by Thurston Moore: ""Joni Mitchell! I've used elements of her songwriting and guitar playing, and no one would ever know about it."" Additionally, Joni Mitchell has always used a number of alternative tunings, as does Sonic Youth. The band named a song after her, ""Hey Joni.""  Members of the band have also maintained relationships with other avant-garde artists from other genres and even other media, drawing influence from the work of John Cage and Henry Cowell. For a 1988 Peel Session, Sonic Youth covered three songs by The Fall and ""Victoria"" by The Kinks, also covered by The Fall. Sonic Youth has featured album art by several well-known avant-garde visual artists, such as Mike Kelley and Gerhard Richter, whose paintings from his ""Candles"" series was used as artwork on Daydream Nation.   Members:  Thurston Moore - guitar, bass guitar, vocal; Lee Ranaldo - guitar, vocal; Kim Gordon - bass guitar, guitar, vocal; Mark Ibold - bass guitar; Steve Shelley - drums.

Founding members Thurston Moore (guitar, vocals), Kim Gordon (bass guitar, vocals, guitar) and Lee Ranaldo (guitar, vocals) remained together for the entire history of the band, while Steve Shelley (drums) followed a series of short-term drummers in 1985, and rounded out the core line-up. In their early career Sonic Youth were associated with the no wave art and music scene in New York City. Part of the first wave of American noise rock groups, the band carried out their interpretation of the hardcore punk ethos throughout the evolving American underground that focused more on the DIY ethic of the genre rather than its specific sound. 
The band experienced relative commercial success and critical acclaim throughout their existence, continuing partly into the new millennium, including signing to major label DGC in 1990 and headlining the 1995 Lollapalooza festival. Sonic Youth have been praised for having ""redefined what rock guitar could do"", using a wide variety of unorthodox guitar tunings and preparing guitars with objects like drum sticks and screwdrivers to alter the instruments' timbre. The band is considered to be a pivotal influence on the alternative and indie rock movements. 
In 1999 their music reached a new audience interested in 20th-century classical music and experimental music with the release of SYR4: Goodbye 20th Century, a double album of covers of avant-garde recordings that featured works by avant-garde classical composers such as John Cage, Yoko Ono, Steve Reich, Pauline Oliveros, George Maciunas, Cornelius Cardew, Nicolas Slonimsky and Christian Wolff as played by Sonic Youth along with several collaborators from the modern avant-garde music scene, such as Christian Marclay, William Winant, Wharton Tiers, Takehisa Kosugi and others. 
In 2011 Ranaldo announced that the band was ""ending for a while"" following the separation of married couple Gordon and Moore. Thurston Moore updated and clarified the position in May 2014: ""Sonic Youth is on hiatus. The band is a democracy of sorts, and as long as Kim and I are working out our situation, the band can't really function reasonably."" Gordon refers several times in her 2015 autobiography Girl in a Band to the band having ""split up"". 

History:

Formation and early history: 1977-1981:
Shortly after guitarist Thurston Moore moved to New York City in early 1977, he formed a group, Room Tone, with his roommates, who would soon change their name to the Coachmen. After the breakup of the Coachmen, Moore began jamming with Stanton Miranda, whose band, CKM, featured Kim Gordon. Moore and Gordon formed a band, appearing under names like Male Bonding and Red Milk and the Arcadians, before settling on Sonic Youth just before June 1981. The name came from combining the nickname of MC5's Fred ""Sonic"" Smith with ""Youth"" from reggae artist Big Youth. Gordon later recalled that ""as soon as Thurston came up with the name Sonic Youth, a certain sound that was more of what we wanted to do came about."" The band played Noise Fest in June 1981 at New York's White Columns gallery, where Lee Ranaldo was playing as a member of Glenn Branca's electric guitar ensemble. Their performance impressed Moore, who described them as ""the most ferocious guitar band that I had ever seen in my life"", and he invited Ranaldo to join the band. The new threesome played three songs at the festival later in the week without a drummer. Each band member took turns playing the drums, until they met drummer Richard Edson. 

Early releases: 1982-1985:
Branca signed Sonic Youth as the first act on his record label Neutral Records. In December 1981 the group recorded five songs in a studio in New York's Radio City Music Hall. The material was released as the Sonic Youth (EP) that, while largely ignored, was sent to a few key members of the US press, who gave it uniformly favorable reviews. After their first release, Edson quit the group for an acting career and was replaced by Bob Bert. 
During their early days as part of the New York music scene, Sonic Youth formed a friendship with noisy New Yorkers Swans. The bands came to share the same rehearsal space, and Sonic Youth embarked on its first tour, a two-week journey through the southern United States starting in November 1982, supporting Swans. During a second tour with Swans of the Midwest the following month, tensions ran high and Moore constantly criticized Bert's drumming, which he felt was not ""in the pocket"". Bert was fired afterwards and replaced by Jim Sclavunos, who played drums on the band's first studio album, 1983's Confusion Is Sex. Sonic Youth set up a two-week tour of Europe for the summer of 1983. Sclavunos, however, quit after only a few months. The group asked Bert to rejoin, and he agreed, on the condition that he would not be fired again after the tour's conclusion. 
Sonic Youth found themselves well received in Europe, but the New York press largely ignored the local noise rock scene. Eventually, as the press began to take notice of the genre, Sonic Youth was grouped along with bands like Big Black, the Butthole Surfers and Pussy Galore under the ""pigfucker"" label by Village Voice music critic Robert Christgau. (Christgau saw these bands as sharing an abrasive, noisy and confrontational aesthetic.) Based on this classification, and on a negative live review by Christgau, a feud developed between Moore and the critic, with Moore renaming the song ""Kill Yr Idols"" to ""I Killed Christgau With My Big Fucking Dick"" before the two sorted out their differences amicably. 
During another tour of Europe in 1984, Sonic Youth's disastrous London debut (where the band's equipment malfunctioned and Moore consequently destroyed the equipment onstage in frustration) actually resulted in rave reviews in Sounds and the NME. By the time they returned to New York, they were so popular they played shows practically every week. That same year, Moore and Gordon were married, and Sonic Youth released Bad Moon Rising, a self-described ""Americana"" album that served as a reaction to the state of the nation at the time. The album, recorded by Martin Bisi, was built around transitional pieces that Moore and Ranaldo had come up with in order to take up time onstage while the other guitarist was busy tuning his instrument; as a result, there are almost no breaks between the songs on the record, which feature walls of feedback and pounding rhythms. Bad Moon Rising featured an appearance by Lydia Lunch on the album's single ""Death Valley '69"", inspired by the Charles Manson Family murders. In contrast to their abrasive, atonal material of the time, the band considered the song relatively conventional. Due to a falling-out with Branca over disputed royalty payments from their Neutral releases, they were signed to Homestead Records by Gerard Cosloy and by Blast First in the UK (which founder Paul Smith created simply so he could distribute the band's records in Europe). While even the New York press ignored Bad Moon Rising upon its release, now viewing the band as too arty and pretentious, Sonic Youth was becoming quite critically acclaimed in the United Kingdom, where the new album had sold 5,000 copies in just six months. 
Claiming he was bored with playing Bad Moon Rising live in its entirety for over a year, Bert quit the group and was replaced by Steve Shelley, formerly of the punk group The Crucifucks. The band was so impressed with Shelley's drumming after seeing him play live they hired him without an audition. Bert remained on good terms with the group; he and Shelley both appeared in the music video for ""Death Valley '69"", as Bert performed the drums on the song, but Shelley was the group's drummer when the video was made. 

SST and Enigma: 1986-1989:
Sonic Youth had a long fascination with influential indie label SST Records. Ranaldo said, ""It was the first record company we were on that we really would have given anything to be on."" Sonic Youth eventually signed to the label in early 1986 and began recording EVOL with Martin Bisi in March of that year. 
EVOL itself represented an evolution of sorts for the band: in addition to increasingly melodic material and the impact of new drummer Shelley's playing, the record also dealt with themes of celebrity, particularly with songs like ""Madonna, Sean, and Me"" (also known as ""Expressway to Yr. Skull"" and called ""a classic"" by Neil Young) and ""Marilyn Moore"". Signing to SST catapulted the band on to a national stage, something that did not happen to their peers in the New York underground. The mainstream music press subsequently began to take notice of the band. Robert Palmer of The New York Times declared that Sonic Youth was ""making the most startlingly original guitar-based music since Jimi Hendrix"" and even People praised EVOL as the ""aural equivalent of a toxic waste dump.""EVOL is also notable for a guest appearance by bass guitarist Mike Watt, a friend whom the band coaxed to come to New York after he was deeply depressed by the death of his bandmate, D. Boon. 
On 1987's Sister, Sonic Youth continued refining their blend of pop song structures with uncompromising experimentalism. Another loose concept album, Sister is partly inspired by the life and works of science fiction writer Philip K. Dick (the ""sister"" of the title was Dick's fraternal twin, who died shortly after her birth, and whose memory haunted Dick his entire life).Sister sold 60,000 copies and received very positive reviews, becoming the first Sonic Youth album to crack the Top 20 of the Village Voice's Pazz & Jop critics poll. 
Despite the critical success, the band was becoming increasingly dissatisfied with SST due to concerns about payment and other administrative practices. Sonic Youth decided to release their next record on Enigma Records, which was distributed by Capitol Records and partly owned by EMI. The 1988 double LP Daydream Nation was a critical success that earned Sonic Youth substantial acclaim. The album came in second on the Village Voice Pazz & Jop poll and topped the year-end album lists of the NME, CMJ and Melody Maker. In 2005, it was one of 50 recordings chosen that year by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry. The lead single from the album, ""Teen Age Riot"", was the first song from the band to reach significant success, receiving heavy airplay in modern and college rock stations. A number of prominent music periodicals including Rolling Stone hailed Daydream Nation as one of the best albums of the decade and named Sonic Youth as the ""Hot Band"" in its ""Hot"" issue. Unfortunately, distribution problems arose and Daydream Nation was often difficult to find in stores. Moore considered Enigma a ""cheap-jack Mafioso outfit"" and the band began looking for a major label deal. 

Major label career and alternative icons: 1990-1999:

In 1990, Sonic Youth released Goo (their first album for Geffen), which featured the single ""Kool Thing"" on which Chuck D from rap group Public Enemy guested. ""Kool Thing"" was later featured in the Hal Hartley film Simple Men and the video game Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock and was made available as a paid download for the Rock Band video game. The record is considered much more accessible than their previous work. 
In 1992, the band released Dirty on the DGC label. Their influence as tastemakers continued with their discovery of acclaimed skateboard video director Spike Jonze, who they recruited for the video for ""100%"", which also featured skateboarder turned actor Jason Lee. This song, along with the Gordon tune ""JC"", contains lyrical references to the murder of Joe Cole, a friend who worked with Black Flag as a roadie. The album features artwork by Los Angeles-based artist Mike Kelley. ""Dirty"" features a guest appearance by Ian MacKaye (Minor Threat, Fugazi) playing guitar on the track ""Youth Against Fascism"". 
In 1993, the band contributed the track ""Burning Spear"" to the AIDS benefit album No Alternative, produced by the Red Hot Organization. 
In 1994, the band released Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star, their best-charting release in the United States (until 2009's The Eternal), which peaked at No. 34 on the Billboard 200. The album was filled with low-key melodies and even produced a hit single, ""Bull in the Heather"". Moore and Gordon's daughter, Coco Hayley Gordon Moore, was born earlier in the year, and many of the songs from the album were never played live because there was never a full tour to support the album due to Gordon's pregnancy. In 1994, the band also released a cover of The Carpenters' 1971 hit ""Superstar"" for the tribute album If I Were a Carpenter; their version would later be featured in the 2007 film Juno. 
The band headlined the 1995 Lollapalooza festival with alternative rock groups Hole and Pavement. By that time, alternative rock had gained considerable mainstream attention, and the festival was parodied on The Simpsons 1996 episode ""Homerpalooza"", which featured voiceovers from the band. They also performed the final credits theme for that episode. 
Gordon collaborated in Free Kitten, and started a clothing label X-Girl, based in Los Angeles. Ranaldo and Moore played with many experimental/noise musicians, including William Hooker, Nels Cline, Tom Surgal, Don Dietrich, Christian Marclay, DJ Spooky and Mission of Burma, among others. Shelley started up the Smells Like Records record label, as well as playing in backing bands for Chan Marshall (Cat Power) and Two Dollar Guitar. Thurston Moore also made several guest appearances on DJ Spooky's albums, which combined rock and hip hop. 
From Sonic Youth's earliest days, Gordon had occasionally played guitar with the group. Around the time of A Thousand Leaves and Washing Machine, she began playing guitar more frequently, resulting in a three-guitar and drums lineup. These songs were something of a shift for the group's sound, and would lead to the introduction of a fifth member a few years later. 
The Washing Machine album began a shift in the band away from their punk roots, seeing them working with longer jam sections. Two tracks showed the new approach in full force - the title track ""Washing Machine"", which is just under 10 minutes long, and ""The Diamond Sea"", which is over 19 minutes long. 
During the late 1990s and early 2000s, the band began releasing a series of highly experimental records on their own Hoboken, New Jersey-based label SYR. The music was mostly instrumental and improvised, and the album and track titles and even the liner notes and credits were in different languages: SYR1 was in French, SYR2 in Dutch, SYR3 in Esperanto, SYR5 in Japanese, SYR6 in Lithuanian, SYR7 in Arpitan and SYR8 in Danish. SYR3 was the first to feature Jim O'Rourke, who went on to become an official band member. Tracks from the SYR releases featured in their live sets in 1998, particularly ""Anagrama"" from SYR1, and tracks from SYR2 formed the basis of two tracks from A Thousand Leaves. 
Released in 1998, A Thousand Leaves has a dreamy, semi-improvised feel, and features extended jam sections on tracks such as ""Wildflower Soul"" and ""Female Mechanic Now on Duty"". The album also features two Ranaldo-led numbers, ""Hoarfrost"" and ""Karen Koltrane"". The only single to be released from this album, ""Sunday"", was accompanied by a video directed by Harmony Korine and starring Macaulay Culkin. 
SYR4 was subtitled ""Goodbye, 20th Century"" and featured works by avant-garde classical composers such as John Cage, Yoko Ono, Steve Reich, and Christian Wolff played by Sonic Youth along with several collaborators from the modern avant-garde music scene such as Christian Marclay, William Winant, Wharton Tiers, Takehisa Kosugi and others. The album received mixed reviews, but some critics praised the group's efforts at popularizing and reinterpreting the composers' works. 

Later DGC period: 2000-2006:
On July 4, 1999, Sonic Youth's instruments, amps and gear were stolen in the middle of the night while on tour in Orange, California (see initial post on Usenet). Forced to start from scratch with new instruments, they recorded NYC Ghosts & Flowers and opened for Pearl Jam during the east coast leg of their 2000 tour. 
In 2001 Sonic Youth collaborated with French avant-garde singer and poet Brigitte Fontaine on Fontaine's album Kékéland. 
When the September 11, 2001 attacks occurred, several members of the band were blocks away; Jim at their NYC studio (Echo Canyon on Murray Street) and Ranaldo and his wife Leah nearby at home. After the attacks, they curated the first U.S. outing of the All Tomorrow's Parties music festival in L.A. The festival was originally scheduled for October, but it was delayed until March the following year due to the attacks. 
In the summer of 2002, Murray Street was released; many critics heralded a ""return to form for SY"", seemingly revitalized by the addition of Jim O'Rourke, who became a full member during this period, playing bass guitar, guitar and occasionally synthesizer. It was during this period that the band were filmed for Scott Crary's documentary Kill Your Idols, depicting Sonic Youth as a key influence upon the post-punk revival then happening in New York. This was followed in 2004 by the release of Sonic Nurse, an album similar in sound and approach to its immediate predecessor that also received positive reviews. ""Pattern Recognition"", a song named after the 2003 William Gibson novel, finds the band once again using Gibson's work for inspiration. The band also showed their pop culture commentary and sense of humor with the track ""Mariah Carey and the Arthur Doyle Hand Cream"", a faster-tempo song sung by Gordon, which spoofed Carey's life, including her short-lived relationship with rapper Eminem, which originally appeared on a 2003 split 7"" with Erase Errata (on the album cover, the reference to ""Mariah Carey"" in the title was replaced by ""Kim Gordon"" due to potential copyright issues.)Sonic Nurse had decent sales, in part due to performances on TV talk shows including Late Night with Conan O'Brien and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. The band was also slated to perform in 2004's Lollapalooza tour along with acts such as Pixies and The Flaming Lips, but the concert was canceled due to lackluster ticket sales. When the band toured later that year, they played extensively from their 1980s catalog. 

On October 6, 2005, LA CityBeat reported that some of the gear stolen in 1999 was surprisingly recovered and that it might be used for recording of the next album, then tentatively titled Sonic Life. The report also said that Jim O'Rourke might be leaving the band soon; his departure was confirmed by Lee Ranaldo in an interview with Pitchfork Media. In May 2006, the group announced on their website that ex-Pavement member Mark Ibold would play bass for the band on their upcoming tour. 
Rather Ripped was released in Europe on June 5, 2006 and in the USA on June 13, 2006. Compared to previous Sonic Youth recordings, the album features many short, conventionally-structured, melodic songs and fewer feedback-fuelled left-field improvisations (the band's avant-garde tendencies nowadays have been largely exorcised through SYR releases and solo outings rather than band albums). Later that summer, Sonic Youth played the 2006 Bonnaroo Festival, as well as Lollapalooza, promoting the album. In December, Rolling Stone made it their number three Album of the Year 2006. 
The band released The Destroyed Room: B-Sides and Rarities in December 2006. It features tracks previously available only on vinyl, limited-release compilations, B-sides to international singles, and some material that had never before been released. This marked the band's final Geffen release. 

Independent agents and signing to Matador: 2007-2011:
In April, 2007, the band became one of the earlier big-name rock bands to play China when they were brought on a China tour by Beijing and Shanghai based company Split Works. 
In 2008, the band independently re-released Master=Dik for the first time on CD, exclusively at their online store. They also released two more editions to the SYR series, SYR7: J'Accuse Ted Hughes and SYR8: Andre Sider Af Sonic Youth. SYR7 was released on April 22, and SYR8 was released July 28. On June 10, they also released a compilation album on Starbucks Music, called Hits Are for Squares. The first fifteen tracks were selected by other celebrities, and track sixteen, ""Slow Revolution"", is a new recording by Sonic Youth. 
Also in June, the band was the subject of an intensively researched biography, Goodbye 20th Century: A Biography of Sonic Youth, written by music journalist David Browne. The book featured new interviews with the band as well as nearly one-hundred friends, family members and peers. It was published by Da Capo and included over sixty rare photos. 
On August 30, 2008, the band premiered two new songs at the final McCarren Park Pool show. Thurston Moore stated that in November the band would start recording a new studio album. The band did not continue their contract with Geffen, being discontented at the way Geffen handled their last four or five albums. On September 8, it was confirmed by Matador's Matablog that Sonic Youth would release its sixteenth album (titled The Eternal) in spring, 2009, on Matador Records. In December, it was also announced that the group had recently collaborated with John Paul Jones (of Led Zeppelin fame) on a piece that served as the soundtrack for a new Merce Cunningham Dance Company piece. This work was performed by the company on April 16-19, 2009, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in celebration of Cunningham's 90th birthday. On February 12, 2009 the band revealed the cover art for The Eternal via their website and blog. The album, produced by John Agnello, was released on June 9. With the release, Matador Records also offered an exclusive live LP only available to those who preordered the album. The band scored and composed the soundtrack of the French thriller-drama Simon Werner a Disparu, which premiered in May, 2010 as part of the Cannes International Film Festival. The soundtrack has been released in 2011 as SYR9: Simon Werner a Disparu, the latest edition of the SYR series. 

Band split (2011):
On October 14, 2011, Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore announced that they separated after 27 years of marriage through a statement by Matador. Matador also explained that plans for the band remained ""uncertain"", despite previously hinting that they would record new material later in the year. 
In an interview on November 28, 2011, Lee Ranaldo said that Sonic Youth are ""ending for a while"". ""I'm feeling optimistic about the future no matter what happens at this point"", Ranaldo said. ""It was a pretty good tour overall. I mean, there was a little bit of tiptoeing around and some different situations with the travelling - you know, they're not sharing a room any more or anything like that ... It remains to be seen at this point what happens. I think they are certainly the last shows for a while and I guess I'd just leave it at that."" Ranaldo also suggested there are no plans for Sonic Youth to record new material. ""There's tons and tons of archival projects and things like that still going on,"" he said. ""I'm just happy right now to let the future take its course."" 
In November 2013, Ranaldo said in response to the question of a possible reunion, ""I fear not. Everybody is busy with their own projects, besides that Thurston and Kim aren't getting along together very well since their split. I think you can put a cross behind Sonic Youth, same as you can put it behind the names Mike Kelley and Lou Reed. Let them all rest in peace."" In her 2015 autobiography Girl in a Band, Gordon refers several times to the band having ""split up"" for good. 

Musical style and influences:
Sonic Youth are considered a pioneering band in the noise rock and alternative rock genres. Their music has also been labelled experimental rock, indie rock and post-punk. 

Alternative tunings:

Sonic Youth's sound relied heavily on the use of alternative tunings. Scordatura on stringed instruments has been used for centuries and alternative guitar tunings had been used for decades in blues music, and to a limited degree in rock music (such as with Lou Reed's Ostrich guitar on The Velvet Underground & Nico). Azerrad writes that early in their career, 

Sonic Youth could only afford cheap guitars, and cheap guitars sounded like cheap guitars. But with weird tunings or something jammed under a particular fret, those humble instruments could sound rather amazing - bang a drum stick on a cheap Japanese Stratocaster copy in the right tuning, crank the amplifier to within an inch of its life and it will sound like church bells. 

The tunings were painstakingly developed by Moore and Ranaldo during the band's rehearsals; Moore once reported that the odd tunings were an attempt to introduce new sounds: ""When you're playing in standard tuning all the time ... things sound pretty standard."" Rather than re-tune for every song, Sonic Youth generally used a particular guitar for one or two songs, and would take dozens of instruments on tour. This would be the source of much trouble for the band, as some songs rely on specific guitars that have been uniquely prepared. 

Influences:
Besides The Stooges, Branca, Patti Smith, Wire,Public Image Ltd and French avant-gardist Brigitte Fontaine, another influence was 1980s-era hardcore punk; after seeing Minor Threat perform in May 1982, Moore declared them ""the greatest live band I have ever seen"". He also saw The Faith performing in 1981 and had a strong admiration towards their only two records, a split LP with fellow Washington, D.C. hardcore band Void and the EP Subject to Change. While recognizing that their own music was very different from hardcore, Moore and Gordon, especially, were impressed by hardcore's speed and intensity, and by the nationwide network of musicians and fans. ""It was great"", said Moore, ""the whole thing with slam dancing and stage diving, that was far more exciting than pogoing and spitting. ... I thought hardcore was very musical and very radical."" 
Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo expressed on numerous occasions their admiration for the music of Joni Mitchell, such as this quote by Thurston Moore: ""Joni Mitchell! I've used elements of her songwriting and guitar playing, and no one would ever know about it."" Additionally, as with Sonic Youth, Joni Mitchell has always used a number of alternative tunings. The band named a song after her, ""Hey Joni"". 
Members of the band have also maintained relationships with other avant-garde artists from other genres and even other media, drawing influence from the work of John Cage and Henry Cowell. For a 1988 John Peel Session, Sonic Youth covered three songs by The Fall and ""Victoria"" by The Kinks, also covered by The Fall. Sonic Youth has featured album art by several well-known avant-garde visual artists, such as Mike Kelley, Tony Oursler and Gerhard Richter, whose paintings from his ""Candles"" series was used as artwork on Daydream Nation. 

Musical instruments:
Sonic Youth's sound was generated by their vast collection of unique and exclusive instruments; from guitars altered to meet the needs of the unique tunings employed to effects and amps designed to around their whims, Sonic Youth used a wide array of custom instruments in creating their sound. The Sound Destruction Device is an example of an effect designed for them, in which a fuzz pedal with two gain stages and gate creates oscillating distortion sounds.

History:
The Felice Brothers got their start as a band playing in the New York City subway. They stayed in a little apartment in Brooklyn and would play in the subway stations at 42nd Street and Union Square and in Greenwich Village.

History and work:
Garbus was born in 1979 and was raised in New York and in New Canaan, Connecticut. She attended Smith College. She was a puppeteer for the Sandglass Theater in Vermont and lived in Montreal where she played ukulele in the band Sister Suvi with guitarist Patrick Gregoire and drummer Nico Dann. After releasing her first Tune-Yards album in 2009, she moved to Oakland, California, where her partner in Tune-Yards, Nate Brenner, also lives. 
The first Tune-Yards album, Bird-Brains (stylized as BiRd-BrAiNs) was originally self-released by Garbus on recycled cassette tape. It was recorded using only a handheld voice recorder. A limited edition vinyl was released in June 2009, via the Portland-based imprint Marriage Records. In July 2009, it was announced that Tune-Yards had signed to 4AD, and a limited edition pressing of Bird-Brains was released on August 17, 2009. A full worldwide release followed on November 16, 2009 (and November 17 in North America). The autumn 2009 pressing was remastered at Abbey Road Studios by Christian Wright, and includes two new bonus tracks: ""Want Me To"" and ""Real Live Flesh."" 
A second album, Whokill (stylized as W H O K I L L), was released on April 19, 2011. A single from it, ""Bizness"", came out in February 2011. It was produced by Garbus and engineered by Eli Crews at New, Improved Studios in Oakland, California. Applying the live approach to Garbus' studio work for the first time, Garbus works with bass player Nate Brenner, who co-wrote some of the album's songs. Comparing the act to Sonic Youth, Frontier Psychiatrist said, ""if Bird-Brains was Garbus' Evol, a record bursting with musical ideas that attempted to subvert the notion of song, who kill is Garbus' Sister, a record that embraces the traditional pop song as a vehicle to convey those ideas."" The album as well as singles ""Bizness"" and ""Gangsta"" received mention on many top 2011 album and song lists, including Time Magazine, Rolling Stone, Spin Magazine, and the New York Times. In early 2012, the Village Voice's annual ""Pazz and Jop"" poll of critics named Whokill the No. 1 album of 2011. The song ""Fiya"" is featured on a 2010 commercial for the Blackberry Torch, while the song ""Gangsta"" has been used in the television shows Orange Is the New Black, Weeds and The Good Wife. 
Garbus started recording material for her third LP during the latter half of 2013, with a working title of Sink-o. A May 6, 2014 release date was later announced with the title Nikki Nack.

Their music is difficult to define, straddling both world and rock and often imbued with timeless Hispano - classical influences. The fire in their music comes from their life-long passion for metal music. In spring 2006, ""Rodrigo y Gabriela,"" beat both the Arctic Monkeys AND Johnny Cash to number one in the Irish charts. Both the artists and their third self-titled album have gone on to enjoy international success since its initial release in early 2006.  Rodrigo is a deft finger-picker who can move from raging speed to sensual soul in the space of a fret, while Gabriela employs fast, rhythmic techniques. Her percussionist's thrashing of strings and drumming of the instrument's body inevitably raises comparisons with the flamenco style of rumba, but the band specifically denies a flamenco influence. Nonetheless, it is often referred to as ""nuevo flamenco"", symbolising a sort of renaissance of the traditionally Spanish music genre whose origins began in the Middle East when the Moors brought their cultural music to Europe. The duo's repertoire flies beyond familiar latin folk guitarists' styles because of the metal connection: their reworkings of Led Zeppelin's ""Stairway to Heaven"" and Metallica's ""Orion"" are musts, and the presence on ""Ixtapa"" of the fiery hungarian gypsy violinist Roby Lakatos is inspirational.  The Story: Rodrigo and Gabriela met as teenagers, at the Casa de Cultura (House of Culture), in Mexico City, where Rodrigo's brother was Director. Rodrigo was playing drums in his band Castlow - a code word he never revealed to Gabriela, and changed to Tierra Acida (Acid Earth) when she joined them on guitar. The couple drifted together through music; teenaged metal fanatics who both failed entrance to the Conservatory and moved into rock. Before joining Tierra Acida, Gabriela ran three girls' bands, Las Brujas (The Witches), Subterraneo and Las Formigas (The Ants) at once: Terra Acida had a disciplined work ethic: ""It was mental!"" she recalls, ""we rehearsed five hours a day, every day, with very short breaks, and not much talking!""   Tierra Acida played in Mexico City's roughest clubs and lived off day-jobs (Gabriela taught Metallica riffs to local kids; Rodrigo at a TV station, doing music for programmes). They recorded an album but wouldn't sign the record contract, planning instead to concentrate on learning more guitar styles. In fact, they just hung out with friends and survived by playing bossa novas in the hotel bars. ""Then we decided to travel to Europe"".  Their first port of call was Dublin, Ireland. ""It was the most unknown place to us"", explains Gabriela, the talkative one. ""Also, a Mexican girl offered us her house there."" They landed in Dublin at night, spoke no English, and had $1,000 between them. They found a note on the door saying actually, sorry, but they couldn't stay there after all, so the taxi driver drove them round hostels and hotels all night. Eventually they rented a place - and soon the money disappeared: ""So - we had to busk"". That was 1999: ""We were very exotic specimens!"" They built a reputation and landed gigs in people's homes, at wedding parties and gallery openings, playing covers and their own compositions, ""We still wanted to be metal composers, but everything came out as Latin!""   Dublin was booming then, with new music venues and galleries and a thriving rock scene, and the two Mexicans jammed with local folk musicians in the bars. In winter, they moved to Denmark and started again - this time busking at minus three degrees! The brief Copenhagen experience inspired two numbers on the current album, ""Diablo Rojo"", a scary roller-coaster ride in the city, and ""Viking Man"", their nickname for a homeless man they befriended, who pushed them into busking on the freezing streets.   Next, they hit Barcelona, but this time, the club owners assumed they played mariachi, and wouldn't let them play in their own unique style, so Rod & Gab ended up jamming on Barca's main drag Las Ramblas getting heavy duty hassle from the Catalan cops. Just in time, a call came from Ireland to come back and play the newly opened Sugar Club. Damian Rice, then a busking friend, invited them to support his shows, and in 2003, they released ""re-Foc"", and a year later, ""Live Manchester And Dublin,"" which both launched them onto the world music circuit - and beyond.   The Music: Rodrigo and Gabriela describe their style as 'fusion music': ""It's mainly got latin harmonies and rhythms but the structure is rock. It's not jazz because it's structured, and we don't improvise; our solos are exactly what's on the record, as a metal fan and guitarist you always want to hear the same f**king solo!""  Influences range from family salsa records to Gabriela's aunt's pink floyd, black sabbath, queen, and led zeppelin vinyl, with Rodrigo also embracing a similar classic rock lineage. But crucially they grew up during Mexico's 'metal era.' ""People expected two acoustic guitarists would play classical music, but we dropped in extracts from Led Zep, Hendrix and Metallica, then we did the same with ""Stairway to Heaven!"" Their music is instrumental ""with very lyrical themes.""  Mentions of flamenco influences raise sharp responses: ""To many music fans, it sounds like flamenco, and we're great flamenco fans, but we don't play it"" says Gabriela. ""The only similarity is that our music is guitar music and it's very rhythmic.""  This album's producer John Leckie (Radiohead, Muse, My Morning Jacket) arrived on the scene via a demo sent to him by their Irish record label, and he called the very next day. The three agreed to record 'live', and Rodrigo and Gabriela were placed in the same room in a studio in Bath, England, to perform as if on stage: ""We played each track over and over, and only 'Orion' has overdubs."" Roby Lakatos, the fiery gypsy violinist was the only outsider, and his presence on ""Ixtapa"" is wonderful. ""We saw him on TV"", Gabriela remembers, ""Playing at a concert in Amsterdam, and we sent him our music. He improvised this whole piece in two hours!"" From the many, many live versions, Leckie chose 'the one.'   The Touring The global success of 'Rodrigo y Gabriela' (300,000 worldwide sales and counting) has been spurred on by Rod & Gab's dedication to hard work on the road. 2006 saw three UK tours and three US tours, plus extensive European and Australian sojourns. 2007 has seen them back in the United States (once Rodrigo's visa problems were sorted out by the State Department) and the UK for many more shows, including festival spots at Coachella, Glastonbury, V, Bonnaroo, Oxegen (Ireland), Latitude, Pukkelpop (Belgium), Lowlands (The Netherlands) and countless others.

It's easy to forget sometimes. Like when ..., Rodrigo y Gabriela (Rodrigo and Gabriela) are a Mexican acoustic guitar duo whose music is influenced by a number of genres including nuevo flamenco, rock, and heavy metal. The duo's recordings consist largely of instrumental duets on the classical guitar. Currently residing in Mexico City, they began their career in Dublin, Ireland, during an eight-year stay. They have released five studio albums, three live albums and one EP. In 2011 they collaborated with Hans Zimmer on the Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides soundtrack while also contributing to the soundtrack for the Shrek prequel Puss in Boots. They have toured internationally and in May 2010, performed at The White House for President Barack Obama. 

Early life:
Rodrigo Sánchez (born 1974) and Gabriela Quintero (born 1973) grew up in middle-class families in Mexico City. Their parents listened to flamenco, jazz, and rock music but they were both exposed to heavy metal, like Metallica, which proved influential to Rodrigo and Gabriela. 
Rodrigo and Gabriela met at the age of 15, at the Casa de Cultura (House of Culture) in Mexico City, where Rodrigo's brother was the director. Quintero was in a drama class and at the suggestion of his brother, Rodrigo met up with her. She remembers ""this 15-year-old boy there, dressed in a black ... with messy hair. Yet he was different to the other metal-heads his age: he seemed very serious and didn't drink or smoke"". The two bonded over their interest in music and they soon became a couple. 
In the early 1990s, Sánchez formed a heavy metal band called Tierra Acida (Acid Land) with his brother. Quintero joined them in 1993 ""as they couldn't get a guitarist who would please Rodrigo"". When a record deal for the band fell through in 1997, Sánchez and Quintero left Mexico City for the resort town of Ixtapa on the Pacific coast of Mexico. They played in beach side bars and hotels for nine months where ""we wanted to play a different kind of music, something we could make as our own"". 

Career:
Growing frustrated with the limited scope of the domestic Mexican music scene, the duo moved to Europe. After travelling around, they took up residence in Dublin, Ireland, in 1999, despite not speaking any English. Playing live gigs in various pubs and busking on Grafton Street where they began to play ""many cover songs, which we enjoyed. Then we began to put in our own songs, and we've built up our repertoire from there"". They became friends with fellow musician Damien Rice who invited them to open for one of his shows. He also introduced the duo to Niall Muckian, who became their manager. In the first half of 2001 they recorded a 9-track demo called Foc of their own material supplemented by some covers, also featuring an appearance by Zoe Conway. 
As interest in the band grew, it was decided to re-record the songs on the demo as re-Foc in 2002 with a number of friends, including Lisa Hannigan who provided vocal stylings and Conway, who by now also was a feature of the live set-up of the duo. The album appeared on Muckian's own Rubyworks Records as he found that ""because it is all instrumental, we found it hard to get major-label interest or any radio-play, so I put it out myself"". As interest grew, the duo were offered further support-slots, which resulted in an eight-track live-album recorded in Dublin and Manchester, released in 2004. 
The eponymous album, Rodrigo y Gabriela, entered the Irish Albums Chart at #1 beating Arctic Monkeys and Johnny Cash to the top spot. It was released internationally on March 13, 2006, having been given an earlier Irish release. Rodrigo y Gabriela, which was produced by John Leckie, includes covers of Led Zeppelin's ""Stairway to Heaven"" and Metallica's ""Orion"". The duo lists Metallica as being among their key influences, alongside other heavy metal bands such as Megadeth, Slayer, Testament and Overkill. The other tracks are original works inspired by the places they have been and the people they have met. 
The duo had their national American TV debut on Late Show with David Letterman on December 18, 2006, performing ""Diablo Rojo"". 

Their song ""Tamacun"" featured in the pilot episode of AMC's Breaking Bad in January 2008. 
Live in Japan was released on October 20, 2008, in the United Kingdom, and includes 14 tracks, and a bonus DVD containing five videos. The Led Zeppelin cover can be found on the album Rhythms del Mundo Classics. 
Their feature on MTV gave them a huge boost in popularity in the United States. This led to a feature on Nightmare Revisited, a tribute album to the music from Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas. The duo performed an instrumental version of ""Oogie Boogie's Song."" 
They released a new album, 11:11, in September, 2009. Alex Skolnick of Testament guests on the album, as do Strunz & Farah. Upon the release of the new album, they received much mainstream American popularity and were the featured music on Monday Night Football on October 12, 2009, as they celebrated Latino Heritage Month. 
Their song ""Santo Domingo"" was chosen as the Starbucks iTunes Pick of the Week for November 10, 2009. 
The duo was the musical guest on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson that aired on CBS-TV on October 28, 2009, and was re-run on December 29, 2009. They performed ""Buster Voodoo."" They performed on Jools Holland's Annual Hootenanny on December 31, 2009. 
The duo was the musical guest on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno that aired on NBC on March 23, 2010, to promote their album 11:11 and on Lopez Tonight which aired on TBS March 25, 2010. 

They headlined the West Holts stage on the Sunday night at Glastonbury 2010 and played the King Tuts Tent at T In The Park on 10 July 2010. They also had a spot on the main stage at Latitude festival that same July and they managed to draw in a huge crowd. 
In 2010, Rodrigo y Gabriela contributed a live version of their song ""Hora Zero"" to the Enough Project and Downtown Records' Raise Hope for Congo compilation. Proceeds from the compilation fund efforts to make the protection and empowerment of Congo's women a priority, as well as inspire individuals around the world to raise their voice for peace in the Congo. 
They played the Nice Jazz Festival on 23 July 2010, and the McMenamin's Edgefield outdoor concert in Portland, Oregon on August 14, 2010, as well as the Ravinia Festival on August 28, 2010, and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on September 30, 2010. 
In September, 2010, the duo announced a hiatus from touring due to stress injuries caused by Gabriela's heavily percussive style of playing. However, they did manage to play five sold-out nights at Shepherds Bush in London. 
On January 20, 2011, Rodrigo y Gabriela entered the studio with Hans Zimmer to write and record sessions of the score from Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. The soundtrack was released on May 17, 2011, three days before the film's general release.

In January 2012 they released Area 52, their first album backed by other musicians. The tracks on the album are mostly re-worked versions of songs that have appeared on their duo albums, Rodrigo y Gabriela and 11:11. Reviews were mixed, with some tracks criticised for the backing band drowning out the guitar work that fans love but others praised where the guitar workouts ""are allowed space to breathe by lighter salsa-style backing."" 
In April 2014, Rodrigo y Gabriela released their fourth studio album, entitled 9 Dead Alive. 

Style:
Reviewing one of their gigs, The Independent noted that ""Rodrigo y Gabriela's secret is maybe quite simple. They are resourceful musicians, and are open-hearted, happy entertainers. That, very often, is what people want."" 
Both Rodrigo and Gabriela play Yamaha NX series electro nylon string guitars exclusively. Rodrigo plays the slimmer neck NTX1200 and Gabriela plays the more traditional sized NCX2000 and NCX1200. 

Personal lives:
Sánchez and Quintero dated for many years before ending their relationship (but not their musical partnership) in 2012. ""We're now better friends by far,"" said Quintero. ""We no longer behave like 15-year-olds and it's allowed us to grow up.""

History:

Formation (2004-2005):
Ben Goldwasser and Andrew VanWyngarden formed the band while attending Wesleyan University during their freshman year. ""We weren't trying to start a band,"" remarked Goldwasser. ""We were just hanging out and showing each other music that we liked."" They experimented with noise rock and electronica before settling on what Paco Alvarez of Spin calls ""their current brand of shape-shifting psychedelic pop."" They graduated in 2005 and toured extensively in support of the Time to Pretend EP, opening for indie pop band Of Montreal. 
The band first started with the name The Management, releasing various demo albums including Climbing to New Lows, but since this name was already being used by another band, they later changed it to MGMT. This abbreviation stands for Management. 

Oracular Spectacular (2006-2009):
In the autumn of 2006, Maureen Kenny signed the band to Columbia Records. When they got a phone call from the A&R department of Columbia Records saying they were interested in their music, they thought it was a joke. The duo recorded with Flaming Lips/Sleater-Kinney music producer Dave Fridmann in 2007 for their major label debut, Oracular Spectacular. MGMT opened for Of Montreal on tour in autumn 2007 as a five-piece touring band including Matthew Asti (bass), James Richardson (drums), and Hank Sullivant (guitar). In November 2007, they performed for the first time in Europe, supporting the band Samantha and The Courteeners at Koko in London, England. After March 2008, Hank Sullivant left the band to pursue his own band, Kuroma. Will Berman joined as the new drummer, James Richardson switched from drums to guitar, and Matthew Asti remained on bass. 
The band supported Radiohead on the Manchester date of their world tour and went on a headline tour of the UK during November 2008, playing at venues such as Manchester Academy and Shepherd's Bush Empire. 
MGMT opened for M.I.A. on the Vassar College date of her 2008 tour, and also played several shows with Beck while he toured in 2008. They appeared at the 2008 and 2009 editions of the Bonnaroo Music Festival. Bruce Springsteen was in attendance during their 2009 Bonnaroo late-night set, which followed his headlining appearance on What Stage. They also toured Australia with a headlining spot on the Meredith Music Festival line-up. 
They also played a show at the Virgin Music Festival on the Toronto Islands on September 6, 2008, playing nine songs off their Oracular Spectacular album. They also played the 2008 Street Scene festival in San Diego, California. On February 27, 2009, MGMT performed alongside Spectrum at The Dome in Finsbury Park. MGMT also played another show in Australia at the 2009 Splendour in the Grass Festival. MGMT headlined this music festival along with other well known bands such as Bloc Party, The Flaming Lips, Happy Mondays, and Jane's Addiction. 
MGMT opened for Paul McCartney, an admitted fan, at Fenway Park in Boston, Massachusetts, on August 5 and 6, 2009. 
On August 15, 2009, MGMT played in Hamburg, Germany, at the Dockville Festival and performed several songs from their upcoming album.

The band, including Matthew Asti, James Richardson, and Will Berman from the live band, spent the summer of 2009 in Malibu, California, recording the album with Pete Kember (a.k.a. Sonic Boom) -- formerly of Spacemen 3 and Spectrum - serving as producer/guru, and long-time friend, Billy Bennett (also an NCAA record holding kicker for the University of Georgia), as engineer. 
MGMT originally suggested that they might not release any singles from the album. By July 2010, however, four single releases from the album had been confirmed. The album cover art for Congratulations was created for MGMT by Anthony Ausgang and the overall design of the packaging is by Josh Cheuse of Sony Entertainment. On March 9, 2010, MGMT released the song ""Flash Delirium"" for free download on their official website. On March 20, the band allowed users to stream their new album from their website.

The event draws nearly 120,000 attendees annually. On October 31, 2010, the band performed for the Voodoo Experience in New Orleans, Louisiana. The band decided to dress as the main characters from Scooby-Doo for Halloween; Andrew dressed up as Daphne and Ben dressed up as Velma. They headlined at Fun Fun Fun Fest which was held at Waterloo Park in Austin, Texas on November 6, 2010. The performance was the last show in the US for MGMT in 2010. Their first 2011 gig was at Mar del Plata, Argentina, in front of a crowd of more than 40,000 on the beach in a free event which they headlined. 
MGMT began their first Asian tour on February 22, 2011. 
On September 22, 2011 MGMT performed the Pink Floyd song ""Lucifer Sam"" during Late Night with Jimmy Fallon's ""Pink Floyd Week"". 

MGMT and possible hiatus (2012-2015):
In January 2012, MGMT confirmed in an interview with Intercourse Magazine that they had started work on their third album, with VanWyngarden stating that he had written five songs. On February 27, 2012, MGMT began recording the album with Dave Fridmann at his Tarbox Road Studios. In March 2012, VanWyngarden said that MGMT will perform new songs on their upcoming shows in Latin America. On March 30, 2012, the band premiered a new song, entitled ""Alien Days"", at a show in Bogotá, Colombia. The band performed on August 3, 2012 in Montreal, Quebec at Osheaga, and on August 5, 2012 in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, US at Musikfest. 
In January 2013, NME and Rolling Stone published an interview in which the band announced that the album was tentatively scheduled for a June 2013 release. As of March 2013, the process of recording the album at Tarbox Road Studios with Fridmann was near completion. 
On April 20, 2013, the band released the studio version of ""Alien Days"". The band then embarked on a spring tour, followed by fall/autumn and winter tour dates for North America. Following VanWyngarden's shoulder surgery in mid-2013, former touring member Hank Sullivant rejoined the band to play live guitar for the remainder of 2013. Sullivant played with VanWyngarden when they were in high school and is in the band Kuroma, whose next album is produced by Goldwasser. 
The self-titled album was released September 17, 2013. An exclusive early release of the album, along with a full-length music video called Optimizer, was available from the Rdio music service on September 9, 2013. 
In June 2013, the band performed at the FireFly Music Festival in Dover, Delaware as a headlining band. 
They performed at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April 2014 before embarking on a European tour later in June 2014 and performing at the Glastonbury Festival in England. In July 2014, they were nominated for a VMA in the category ""Best Editing"" for their music video ""Your Life is a Lie"". In an interview at Falls Festival Marion Bay in 2014, the band announced that they will take a short break and come back stronger with a new sound. Will Berman stated in an interview with HitFix in April 2015 that ""We've been taking a little break I guess. We've been at it for years at this point. There's more to come."" He didn't want to speak for either Ben or Andrew on when there would be a new album from the group. 

Legal proceedings:
In January 2009, MGMT demanded compensation from the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) Party. The UMP, headed by Nicolas Sarkozy, the former President of France, had used the song Kids without permission at a party conference and in two online videos in 2008. 
In an official statement, MGMT remarked that ""the fact that the UMP used our song without permission while simultaneously pushing anti-piracy legislation seemed a little wack."" 
The UMP initially offered a symbolic compensation of €1 to MGMT, but the band refused that offer. Finally, in April 2009, the parties settled out of court, and the UMP agreed to pay MGMT around €2,500 for legal fees and €30,000 for copyright infringement. MGMT donated this money to an artists' rights organization. 

Collaborations:
They have collaborated with the rapper Kid Cudi, and are featured on one track - ""Pursuit of Happiness"" from his album Man on the Moon: The End of Day. For the 2010 MTV VMA's Kid Cudi was nominated for Best Hip-Hop video for ""Pursuit of Happiness"" a track which features MGMT and Ratatat. They also collaborated on the track ""Worm Mountain"" on The Flaming Lips' Embryonic. 
On September 4, 2009, Beck announced his second Record Club covers album, Songs of Leonard Cohen. MGMT contributed, alongside Devendra Banhart, Andrew Stockdale of Wolfmother and Binki Shapiro of Little Joy. Andrew VanWyngarden chose the album.

Glenn de Randamie (6 August 1984), better known as Typhoon, is a Dutch rapper. He signed by Dutch hip-hop record label Top Notch.

Music:
Typhoon's music is marked by complicated arrangements and careful orchestration. Live performances routinely involve 12 or more band members playing at once. According to Lauren Rosenthal at mySpoonful which describes new music: ""The group masterfully combines indie rock instrumentals and vocals with violins, percussion, hand claps, xylophone, horns and a choir of other instruments, making for inspiring and catchy songs."" The indie rock band out of Portland, Oregon emulates sounds similar to Frightened Rabbit, Bright Eyes, Beirut, and Arcade Fire.  
Their early recordings reveal a greater degree of experimentation with various styles, including a number of ""sea shanties"", country western and Eastern European-inspired songs. Their more recent output, including their album Hunger & Thirst and its companion EP, A New Kind of House, show a more focused and consistent sound, and a greater focus on creating a cohesive thematic through-line. Many of the songs are preoccupied with mortality and directly reference lead singer and primary songwriter Kyle Morton's own struggle with Lyme Disease as a child. 
In 2010 Typhoon was voted number two on Willamette Week's annual list of the top ten best new bands in Portland. Their music has appeared on the SyFy series Being Human and the NBC series Chuck. They have opened for The Thermals, Quasi, Yann Tiersen, Explosions in the Sky, The Decemberists, and The Shins and toured with Lady Lamb the Beekeeper. Their song ""The Honest Truth"" was ranked #3 in Paste magazine's list of the 50 best songs of 2011.

The current lineup of Dirty Projectors is Dave Longstreth (vocals, multiple instruments), Amber Coffman (vocals, guitar), Nat Baldwin (bass), Mike Johnson (drums), Olga Bell (vocals, keyboard) and Haley Dekle (vocals). Angel Deradoorian (vocals, keyboard) went on an indefinite hiatus from the band in 2012.  Based in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn with connections to the Portland, OR music scene, the group has produced a distinctive sound of electronic experimentation, melded with traditional instruments and harmonically complex vocals. Their recordings range from Prince-style one-man-recording-studio productions (The Glad Fact), to arranged orchestrations (the ""Slaves' Graves"" half of Slaves' Graves & Ballads), to basic voice over nylon-string guitar (the ""Ballads"" half of the aforementioned) to an amalgamation of all these tactics (the 'glitch opera' of The Getty Address and the mixed nature of New Attitude EP). Throughout, Longstreth's aggressively melodic vocals provide a consistent identity for otherwise widely divergent approaches to pop music. Longstreth claims influences ranging from Don Henley to Mariah Carey. The former's influence is most easily seen in The Getty Address album, which is a conceptual opera written from the point of view of Henley as a Spanish Conquistador, though the latter's vocal gymnastics clearly provide a clue to Longstreth's approach. Longstreth's latest album, Rise Above, is an attempt to re-imagine the lyrics of Black Flag's Damaged album from memory over complex music that sees influence from the contemporary African blues and funk of such artists as Ali Farka Toure and Konono No. 1.   http://westernvinyl.com/dirty_projectors.htm, Dirty Projectors are the project of Dave Longstreth, a former ..., MANAGEMENT:Jake Friedman (jake@dirtyprojectors.net)PRESS INQUIRIES:U.S.: Judy Silverman @ Motormouth Media (judy@motormouthmedia.com)(323) ..., The brainchild of wilfully eclectic Brooklyn-based performer David Longstreth, Dirty ..., Dirty Projectors are the project of Dave Longstreth, a former ..., _DISCOGRAPHY_ THE GLAD FACT [Western Vinyl, 2003] ""The Glad Fact"" ..., The brainchild of willfully eclectic Brooklyn-based performer David Longstreth, Dirty ..., Dirty Projectors are the project of Dave Longstreth, a former ..., Over three full lengths, an EP, and five different live ..., Dave Longstreth

Dirty Projectors performing in 2008

Dirty Projectors are an American musical group, consisting of David Longstreth (vocals, guitar), Amber Coffman (vocals, guitar), Haley Dekle (vocals), Nat Baldwin (bass), Olga Bell (vocals, keyboards), and Michael Johnson (drums). They have released seven full-length albums. 

History:

Early years and Rise Above (2002-07):
Longstreth's first album, The Graceful Fallen Mango, was released in 2002 under his own name and introduced his distinctive use of song arrangements and his combination of lo-fi and hi-fi production. The album was a project that Longstreth began as a freshman while studying at Yale University. With the help of Adam Forkner of Yume Bitsu, Longstreth recorded and released The Glad Fact on the Western Vinyl label under the name ""The Dirty Projectors."" In 2005, the band released The Getty Address, a concept album about musician Don Henley that features extensive orchestral and choral accompaniment. The diverse, stripped-down New Attitude EP followed in 2006 and featured inklings of the band's later vocal interplay and guitar work. 
In 2007, the band released Rise Above, an album of Black Flag songs as re-imagined from memory. The album introduced the band's distinctive contrast between Longstreth's vocals and the harmonies of Amber Coffman and Susanna Waiche, who was later replaced by Angel Deradoorian. In support of the album, the band performed songs for a Take-Away Show acoustic video session shot by Vincent Moon. 

Domino Records, Bitte Orca, and Mount Wittenberg Orca (2008-11):
In April 2008, Dirty Projectors signed with Domino Records, and the label announced the release of their fifth full-length album, Bitte Orca, for June 9, 2009. That year, the band also collaborated with David Byrne on the song ""Knotty Pine"" for the compilation album Dark Was the Night produced by the Red Hot Organization. Byrne joined the Dirty Projectors onstage to perform this song, along with ""Ambulance Man,"" another collaborative track not included on the compilation, at the ""Dark Was the Night Live"" concert at New York City's Radio City Music Hall on May 3, 2009. 
""Stillness Is the Move"" was the first single released from Bitte Orca, a West African - R&B influenced hybrid, sung by Coffman and inspired by the Wim Wenders film Wings of Desire.Bitte Orca was met with positive reviews, including Rolling Stone magazine rating the album as number 6 on their best 25 albums of 2009. 
Dirty Projectors were to release a new EP in September 2009 titled Temecula Sunrise. While the EP was never released, two of its tracks, ""Ascending Melody"" and ""Emblem of the World,"" were instead offered for free download on the Dirty Projectors website in early 2010. 
On May 8, 2009, members of Dirty Projectors collaborated with Björk to perform an original composition by Longstreth, written for five voices and acoustic guitar, as part of a charity concert to benefit Housing Works, a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing shelter for homeless men, women, and children suffering from AIDS. The concert was held at the Housing Works Bookstore & Café in downtown New York City. On June 30, 2010, Dirty Projectors announced the release of Mount Wittenberg Orca, a digital-only EP with Björk based on the artists' collaboration.Mount Wittenberg Orca was released physically by Domino Records in 2011. 

Swing Lo Magellan (2012-present):
On March 30, 2012, Dirty Projectors released the first single from their upcoming album, Swing Lo Magellan, ""Gun Has No Trigger"". The album was released on July 10 in the United States and on July 9 internationally. 
In September 2012, Dave Longstreth released a short film called ""Hi Custodian"". 
On November 6, 2012, Dirty Projectors released About to Die EP, a digital- and vinyl-release EP featuring several new tracks. 

Musical style and aesthetics:
While often associated with the late 2000s New York indie rock scene, critics have likened Dirty Projectors to musicians from many genres. For example, critics have compared them to new wave artists David Byrne and Squeeze, pop stars Beyoncé and Mariah Carey, and progressive rock musicians Frank Zappa and Yes. In a 2009 interview, Longstreth embraced some such comparisons but expressed a dislike for classic and progressive rock, commenting, ""Steely Dan is a band I'm not that into,"" ""I'm not a huge Yes guy,"" and ""Frank Zappa I fucking hate.""]",0.411036304385,0.640584,"[freak folk, noise pop, new weird america, lo-fi, neo-psychedelic, noise rock, chamber pop, indie pop, nu gaze, indie folk, stomp and holler, indie rock]",0.61591,0.630603940604,0.390441256559,0.316821990899,0.691219454486,1.95035748119e-05,7.0,0.173939209278,0.790397494059,1.0,0.0664928381541,0.950043871362,4.0,0.521500536695,1

It wasn't ..., Led Zeppelin was the definitive heavy metal band. It wasn't ..., Led Zeppelin were an English rock band originally formed in 1968 by guitarist Jimmy Page under the name ""The New Yardbirds"", based on Page's previous band, The Yardbirds. The band formed when Jimmy Page (guitar) recruited Robert Plant (vocals, harmonica), John Paul Jones (bass guitar, keyboards, mandolin), and John Bonham (drums). With their heavy, guitar-driven blues-rock sound, Led Zeppelin are regularly cited as one of the progenitors of heavy metal and hard rock music. However, the band's individualistic style drew from many sources and transcends any one genre. Led Zeppelin did not release songs from their albums as singles in the UK, as they preferred to develop the concept of ""album-oriented rock"".  Thirty years after disbanding following Bonham's death in 1980, the band continues to be held in high regard for their artistic achievements, commercial success, and broad influence. The band have sold over 200 million albums worldwide, including 111.5 million certified units in the United States, making them one of the best-selling music artists of all time. They have had all of their original studio albums reach the top ten of the Billboard album chart in the US, with six reaching the number one spot.  Shortly after their first tour, the group's eponymous first album was released on 12th January 1969. Its blend of blues and rock influences with distorted amplification made it one of the pivotal records in the evolution of heavy metal music. Although several of Led Zeppelin's earliest songs were based on or were cover versions of blues standards, others such as ""Communication Breakdown"" had a unique and distinctively heavy sound. Led Zeppelin also featured delicate acoustic guitar on ""Black Mountain Side"" in which the influence of Davy Graham can be heard, and a combination of acoustic and electric approaches on the reworked folk song ""Babe I'm Gonna Leave You"". The immediate success of the first album kick-started the band's career, especially in the United States, where they would frequently tour.   The second record, simply titled Led Zeppelin II, followed in similar style later that year, and was an even greater success for the group, reaching the number-one chart position in both the United States and the United Kingdom.  Jimmy Page and Robert Plant were blues fanatics; their first album included the Willie Dixon song ""You Shook Me"", and their later hit ""Whole Lotta Love"" was lyrically very similar to an earlier Dixon song. (The band were subsequently accused of using his lyrics without crediting Dixon, and it was not until Chess Records brought suit fifteen years later, that proper credit - and a monetary settlement - was given.)   The band also loved American rock and roll; the exuberant styles of Fats Domino and Little Richard were inspirations, and Led Zeppelin would perform rockabilly songs originally made famous by Elvis Presley and Eddie Cochran. Onstage, Led Zeppelin concerts could last more than three hours; expanded, improvised live versions of their song repertoire often incorporated tight workouts of James Brown, Stax, and Motown-influenced soul music and funk (favourites of bassist Jones and drummer Bonham).  For the writing of the music on their third album, Led Zeppelin III, the band retired to Bron-yr-Aur, a remote cottage in Wales. This resulted in a more acoustic sound (and a song ""Bron-yr-Aur Stomp"", misspellt as ""Bron-y-Aur Stomp"" on the album cover) strongly influenced by Celtic and folk music. Led Zeppelin III also ushered in an era of unique album jackets, this one featuring a wheel that displayed various images through cutouts in the main jacket sleeve when rotated. In November 1970 Led Zeppelin's record label, Atlantic Records, released ""Immigrant Song"" as a single against the band's wishes (Atlantic had earlier released an edited version of ""Whole Lotta Love"" which cut the 5:34 song to 3:10). It included their only B-side, ""Hey Hey What Can I Do"". Even though the band saw their albums as indivisible, whole listening experiences - and their manager, Peter Grant, maintained an aggressive pro-album stance - nine other singles were released without their consent. The group also resisted television appearances, which would have reduced their ability to control their presentation and sound quality. Lack of Zeppelin television exposure also enforced the band's preference that their fans hear and see them in person.  Their fourth album, Led Zeppelin IV was actually untitled, but is commonly referred to as Zoso, Runes, The Fourth Album, Sticks, Man with Sticks, or Four Symbols; it featured ""Stairway to Heaven"", which Jimmy Page performed on stage on a custom-built double-necked electric Gibson guitar, the top neck a twelve-stringed version.  Over twenty-five years after disbanding in response to drummer John Bonham's tragic death in 1980, Led Zeppelin continue to be held in high regard for their artistic achievements, commercial success and influence.  Since they disbanded, Page, Plant, and Jones have only played together on rare occasions. Page and Plant did get back together to record No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded as part of the MTV Unplugged series in 1994, which was accompanied by a worldwide tour, and again in 1998 for the studio album Walking Into Clarksdale. John Paul Jones also has performed since the break up - at the Bonnaroo music festival in Manchester, Tennessee. He was part of a ""SuperJam"" featuring himself on bass, Ben Harper on guitar, and Ahmir ""?uestlove"" Thompson on drums. He also played as a guest during the sets of various other artists throughout the weekend.   Most recently Led Zeppelin have reformed (with Jason Bonham filling in on drums) for a one-off reunion concert in memory of Atlantic Records co-founder and executive Ahmet Ertegün. After a postponement due to Jimmy Page fracturing one of his fingers, the group performed on 10th December 2007 at the O2 Arena, London. The concert was filmed for a potential DVD release.  Jimmy Page has hinted that the group may start work on new material, and that a world tour may be in the works.   Awards and accolades  Led Zeppelin were honoured by US President Barack Obama at the 2012 Kennedy Center Honors Throughout their career, Led Zeppelin have collected many honours and awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006. Among the band's awards are an American Music Award in 2005, and the Polar Music Prize in 2006. Led Zeppelin were the recipient of a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005, and four of their recordings have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. They have been awarded five Diamond albums, as well as fourteen Multi-Platinum, four Platinum and one Gold album in the United States, while in the UK they have five Multi-Platinum, six Platinum, one Gold and four Silver albums. In addition to listing five of their albums among The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, Rolling Stone named Led Zeppelin the 14th-greatest artist of all time in 2004.  Page was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in recognition of his charity work in 2005 and Plant was honoured as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his services to popular music in 2009. The band are ranked number one on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock and Classic Rock's ""50 best live acts of all time"". They were awarded an Ivor Novello Award for ""Outstanding Contribution to British Music"" in 1977, as well as a ""Lifetime Achievement Award"" at the 42nd Annual Ivor Novello awards ceremony in 1997. The band were honoured at the 2008 MOJO Awards with the ""Best Live Act"" prize for their one-off reunion, and were described as the ""greatest rock and roll band of all time"". The three surviving members (Page, Plant, and Jones) were named as 2012 recipients of Kennedy Center Honors.

The group consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. The band's heavy, guitar-driven sound, rooted in blues and psychedelia on their early albums, has earned them recognition as one of the progenitors of heavy metal, though their unique style drew from a wide variety of influences, including folk music. 
After changing their name from the New Yardbirds, Led Zeppelin signed a deal with Atlantic Records that afforded them considerable artistic freedom. Although the group was initially unpopular with critics, they achieved significant commercial success with albums such as Led Zeppelin (1969), Led Zeppelin II (1969), Led Zeppelin III (1970), their untitled fourth album (1971), Houses of the Holy (1973), and Physical Graffiti (1975). Their fourth album, which features the track ""Stairway to Heaven"", is among the most popular and influential works in rock music, and it helped to secure the group's popularity. 
Page wrote most of Led Zeppelin's music, particularly early in their career, while Plant generally supplied the lyrics. Jones' keyboard-based compositions later became central to the group's catalogue, which featured increasing experimentation. The latter half of their career saw a series of record-breaking tours that earned the group a reputation for excess and debauchery. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, their output and touring schedule were limited during the late 1970s, and the group disbanded following Bonham's death from alcohol-related asphyxia in 1980. In the decades that followed, the surviving members sporadically collaborated and participated in one-off Led Zeppelin reunions. The most successful of these was the 2007 Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert in London, with Jason Bonham taking his late father's place behind the drums. 
Led Zeppelin are widely considered one of the most successful, innovative, and influential rock groups in history. They are one of the best-selling music artists in the history of audio recording; various sources estimate the group's record sales at 200 to 300 million units worldwide. With RIAA-certified sales of 111.5 million units, they are the second-best-selling band in the United States. Each of their nine studio albums placed in the top 10 of the Billboard album chart and six reached the number-one spot.Rolling Stone magazine described them as ""the heaviest band of all time"", ""the biggest band of the '70s"", and ""unquestionably one of the most enduring bands in rock history"". They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995; the museum's biography of the band states that they were ""as influential"" during the 1970s as the Beatles were during the 1960s. 

History:

Formation:

In 1966, London-based session guitarist Jimmy Page joined the blues-influenced rock band the Yardbirds to replace bassist Paul Samwell-Smith. Page soon switched from bass to lead guitar, creating a dual lead guitar line-up with Jeff Beck. Following Beck's departure in October 1966, the Yardbirds, tired from constant touring and recording, began to wind down. Page wanted to form a supergroup with him and Beck on guitars, and the Who's Keith Moon and John Entwistle on drums and bass, respectively. Vocalists Steve Winwood and Steve Marriott were also considered for the project. The group never formed, although Page, Beck, and Moon did record a song together in 1966, ""Beck's Bolero"", in a session that also included bassist-keyboardist John Paul Jones. 
The Yardbirds played their final gig in July 1968 at Luton College of Technology in Bedfordshire. They were still committed to several concerts in Scandinavia, so drummer Jim McCarty and vocalist Keith Relf authorised Page and bassist Chris Dreja to use ""the Yardbirds"" name to fulfill the band's obligations. Page and Dreja began putting a new line-up together. Page's first choice for the lead singer was Terry Reid, but Reid declined the offer and suggested Robert Plant, a singer for the Band of Joy and Hobbstweedle. Plant eventually accepted the position, recommending former Band of Joy drummer John Bonham. Jones inquired about the vacant position at the suggestion of his wife after Dreja dropped out of the project to become a photographer. Page had known Jones since they were both session musicians and agreed to let him join as the final member. 

The four played together for the first time in a room below a record store on Gerrard Street in London. Page suggested that they attempt ""Train Kept A-Rollin'"", originally a jump blues song popularised in a rockabilly version by Johnny Burnette, which had been covered by the Yardbirds. ""As soon as I heard John Bonham play,"" Jones recalled, ""I knew this was going to be great ... We locked together as a team immediately"". Before leaving for Scandinavia, the group took part in a recording session for the P.J. Proby album, Three Week Hero. The album's track ""Jim's Blues"", with Plant on harmonica, was the first studio track to feature all four future members of Led Zeppelin. 
The band completed the Scandinavian tour as the New Yardbirds, playing together for the first time in front of a live audience at Gladsaxe Teen Clubs in Gladsaxe, Denmark, on 7 September 1968. Later that month, they began recording their first album, which was based on their live set. The album was recorded and mixed in nine days, and Page covered the costs. After the album's completion, the band were forced to change their name after Dreja issued a cease and desist letter, stating that Page was allowed to use the New Yardbirds moniker for the Scandinavian dates only. One account of how the new band's name was chosen held that Moon and Entwistle had suggested that a supergroup with Page and Beck would go down like a ""lead balloon"", an idiom for disastrous results. The group dropped the 'a' in lead at the suggestion of their manager, Peter Grant, so that those unfamiliar with the term would not pronounce it ""leed"". The word ""balloon"" was swapped for ""zeppelin"", a word which, according to music journalist Keith Shadwick, brought ""the perfect combination of heavy and light, combustibility and grace"" to Page's mind. 
In November 1968, Grant secured a $143,000 advance contract from Atlantic Records, which was then the biggest deal of its kind for a new band. Atlantic were a label with a catalogue of mainly blues, soul, and jazz artists, but in the late 1960s they began to take an interest in British progressive rock acts. Record executives signed Led Zeppelin without having ever seen them. Under the terms of their contract, the band had autonomy in deciding when they would release albums and tour, and had the final say over the contents and design of each album. They would also decide how to promote each release and which tracks to release as singles. They formed their own company, Superhype, to handle all publishing rights. 

Early years: 1968-70:
The band began their first tour of the UK on 4 October 1968, still billed as the New Yardbirds, and played their first show as Led Zeppelin at the University of Surrey in Battersea on 25 October. Tour manager Richard Cole, who would become a major figure in the touring life of the group, organised their first North American tour at the end of the year. Their debut album, Led Zeppelin, was released in the US during the tour on 12 January 1969, and peaked at number 10 on the Billboard chart; it was released in the UK, where it peaked at number 6, on 31 March. According to Steve Erlewine, the album's memorable guitar riffs, lumbering rhythms, psychedelic blues, groovy, bluesy shuffles and hints of English folk, made it ""a significant turning point in the evolution of hard rock and heavy metal"". 

In their first year, Led Zeppelin completed four US and four UK concert tours, and also released their second album, Led Zeppelin II. Recorded mostly on the road at various North American studios, it was an even greater commercial success than their first album, and reached the number one chart position in the US and the UK. The album further developed the mostly blues-rock musical style established on their debut release, creating a sound that was ""heavy and hard, brutal and direct"", and which would be highly influential and frequently imitated. Steve Waksman has suggested that Led Zeppelin II was ""the musical starting point for heavy metal"". 
The band saw their albums as indivisible, complete listening experiences, disliking the re-editing of existing tracks for release as singles. Grant maintained an aggressive pro-album stance, particularly in the UK, where there were few radio and TV outlets for rock music. Without the band's consent, however, some songs were released as singles, particularly in the US. In 1969 an edited version of ""Whole Lotta Love"", a track from their second album, was released as a single in the US. It reached number four in the Billboard chart in January 1970, selling over one million copies and helping to cement the band's popularity. The group also increasingly shunned television appearances, citing their preference that their fans hear and see them in live concerts. 
Following the release of their second album, Led Zeppelin completed several more US tours. They played initially in clubs and ballrooms, and then in larger auditoriums as their popularity grew. Some early Led Zeppelin concerts lasted more than four hours, with expanded and improvised live versions of their repertoire. Many of these shows have been preserved as bootleg recordings. It was during this period of intensive concert touring that the band developed a reputation for off-stage excess. 
In 1970 Page and Plant retired to Bron-Yr-Aur, a remote cottage in Wales, to commence work on their third album, Led Zeppelin III. The result was a more acoustic style that was strongly influenced by folk and Celtic music, and showcased the band's versatility. The album's rich acoustic sound initially received mixed reactions, with critics and fans surprised at the turn from the primarily electric arrangements of the first two albums, further fuelling the band's hostility to the musical press. It reached number one in the UK and US charts, but its stay would be the shortest of their first five albums. The album's opening track, ""Immigrant Song"", was released as a US single in November 1970 against the band's wishes, reaching the top twenty on the Billboard chart. 

""The Biggest Band in the World"": 1971-75:

During the 1970s, Led Zeppelin reached new heights of commercial and critical success that made them one of the most influential groups of the era, eclipsing their earlier achievements. The band's image also changed as the members began to wear elaborate, flamboyant clothing. Led Zeppelin began travelling in a private jet airliner, a Boeing 720, (nicknamed the Starship), rented out entire sections of hotels (including the Continental Hyatt House in Los Angeles, known colloquially as the ""Riot House""), and became the subject of frequently repeated stories of debauchery. One involved John Bonham riding a motorcycle through a rented floor of the Riot House, while another involved the destruction of a room in the Tokyo Hilton, leading to the group being banned from that establishment for life. Although Led Zeppelin developed a reputation for trashing their hotel suites and throwing television sets out of the windows, some suggest that these tales have been exaggerated. According to music journalist Chris Welch, ""Led Zeppelin's travels spawned many stories, but it was a myth that they were constantly engaged in acts of wanton destruction and lewd behaviour"". 
Led Zeppelin released their fourth album on 8 November 1971. In response to the treatment they had received from critics, particularly after Led Zeppelin III, the band decided to release the fourth album with no title, though it is variously referred to as Led Zeppelin IV, Untitled, IV, or, due to the four symbols appearing on the record label, as Four Symbols, Zoso or Runes. In addition to lacking a title, the original cover featured no band name, as the group wished to be anonymous and to avoid easy pigeonholing by the press. With 37 million copies sold, Led Zeppelin IV is one of the best-selling albums in history, and its massive popularity cemented Led Zeppelin's status as superstars in the 1970s. By 2006, it had sold 23 million copies in the United States alone. The track ""Stairway to Heaven"", never released as a single, is sometimes quoted as being the most requested and most playedAlbum-oriented rock (AOR) FM radio song. The group followed up the album's release with tours of the UK, Australasia, North America, Japan, and the UK again from late 1971 through early 1973. 

Led Zeppelin's next album, Houses of the Holy, was released in March 1973. It featured further experimentation by the band, who expanded their use of synthesisers and mellotron orchestration. The predominately orange album cover, designed by the London-based design group Hipgnosis, depicts images of nude children climbing the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland. Although the children are not shown from the front, the cover was controversial at the time of the album's release. As with the band's fourth album, neither their name nor the album title was printed on the sleeve. 
Houses of the Holy topped charts worldwide, and the band's subsequent concert tour of North America in 1973 broke records for attendance, as they consistently filled large auditoriums and stadiums. At Tampa Stadium in Florida, they played to 56,800 fans, breaking the record set by the Beatles' 1965 Shea Stadium concert and grossing $309,000. Three sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden in New York City were filmed for a motion picture, but the theatrical release of this project (The Song Remains the Same) was delayed until 1976. Before the final night's performance, $180,000 of the band's money from gate receipts was stolen from a safe deposit box at the Drake Hotel. 

In 1974, Led Zeppelin took a break from touring and launched their own record label, Swan Song, named after an unreleased song. The record label's logo, based on a drawing called Evening: Fall of Day (1869) by William Rimmer, features a picture of Apollo. The logo can be found on Led Zeppelin memorabilia, especially T-shirts. In addition to using Swan Song as a vehicle to promote their own albums, the band expanded the label's roster, signing artists such as Bad Company, the Pretty Things and Maggie Bell. The label was successful while Led Zeppelin existed, but folded less than three years after they disbanded. 
In 1975, Led Zeppelin's double album Physical Graffiti was their first release on the Swan Song label. It consisted of fifteen songs, of which eight had been recorded at Headley Grange in 1974 and seven had been recorded earlier. A review in Rolling Stone magazine referred to Physical Graffiti as Led Zeppelin's ""bid for artistic respectability"", adding that the only bands Led Zeppelin had to compete with for the title ""The World's Best Rock Band"" were the Rolling Stones and the Who. The album was a massive commercial and critical success. Shortly after the release of Physical Graffiti, all previous Led Zeppelin albums simultaneously re-entered the top-200 album chart, and the band embarked on another North American tour, now employing sophisticated sound and lighting systems. In May 1975, Led Zeppelin played five sold-out nights at the Earls Court Arena in London, at the time the largest arena in Britain. 

Hiatus from touring and return: 1975-77:

Following their triumphant Earls Court appearances, Led Zeppelin took a holiday and planned an autumn tour in America, scheduled to open with two outdoor dates in San Francisco. In August 1975, however, Plant and his wife Maureen were involved in a serious car crash while on holiday in Rhodes, Greece. Plant suffered a broken ankle and Maureen was badly injured; a blood transfusion saved her life. Unable to tour, he headed to the Channel Island of Jersey to spend August and September recuperating, with Bonham and Page in tow. The band then reconvened in Malibu, California. During this forced hiatus much of the material for their next album, Presence, was written. 
By this time, Led Zeppelin were the world's number one rock attraction, having outsold most bands of the time, including the Rolling Stones.Presence, released in March 1976, marked a change in the Led Zeppelin sound towards more straightforward, guitar-based jams, departing from the acoustic ballads and intricate arrangements featured on their previous albums. Though it was a platinum seller, Presence received a mixed reaction among fans and the music press, with some critics suggesting that the band's excesses may have caught up with them. Page had begun using heroin during recording sessions for the album, a habit which may have affected the band's later live shows and studio recordings, although this has been denied by Page. 
Because of Plant's injuries, Led Zeppelin did not tour in 1976. Instead, the band completed the concert film The Song Remains the Same and the accompanying soundtrack album. The film premiered in New York City on 20 October 1976, but was given a lukewarm reception by critics and fans. The film was particularly unsuccessful in the UK, where, unwilling to tour since 1975 because of their tax exile status, Led Zeppelin faced an uphill battle to recapture the public's affection. 

In 1977, Led Zeppelin embarked on another major concert tour of North America. The band set another attendance record, with an audience of 76,229 at their Silverdome concert on 30 April. It was, according to the Guinness Book of Records, the largest attendance to that date for a single act show. Although the tour was financially profitable, it was beset by off-stage problems. On 19 April, over 70 people were arrested as about 1,000 fans tried to gatecrash Cincinnati Riverfront Coliseum for two sold-out concerts, while others tried to gain entry by throwing rocks and bottles through glass doors. On 3 June, a concert at Tampa Stadium was cut short because of a severe thunderstorm, despite tickets indicating ""Rain or Shine"". A riot broke out, resulting in arrests and injuries. 
After the 23 July show at the Day on the Green festival at the Oakland Coliseum in Oakland, California, Bonham and members of Led Zeppelin's support staff were arrested after a member of promoter Bill Graham's staff was badly beaten during the band's performance. The following day's second Oakland concert was the group's final live appearance in the United States. Two days later, as they checked in at a French Quarter hotel for their 30 July performance at the Louisiana Superdome, Plant received news that his five-year-old son, Karac, had died from a stomach virus. The rest of the tour was immediately cancelled, prompting widespread speculation about Led Zeppelin's future. 

Bonham's death and break-up: 1978-80:

In November 1978 the group recorded at Polar Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. The resulting album, In Through the Out Door, featured sonic experimentation that again drew mixed reactions from critics. Nevertheless, the album reached number one in the UK and the US in just its second week of release. With this album's release, Led Zeppelin's entire catalogue returned to the Billboard Top 200 in the weeks of 27 October and 3 November 1979. 
In August 1979, after two warm-up shows in Copenhagen, Led Zeppelin headlined two concerts at the Knebworth Music Festival, playing to a crowd of approximately 104,000 on the first night. A brief, low-key European tour was undertaken in June and July 1980, featuring a stripped-down set without the usual lengthy jams and solos. On 27 June, at a show in Nuremberg, Germany, the concert came to an abrupt halt in the middle of the third song, when Bonham collapsed onstage and was rushed to hospital. Speculation in the press suggested that his collapse had been the result of excessive alcohol and drug use, but the band claimed that he had simply overeaten. 
A North American tour, the band's first since 1977, was scheduled to commence on 17 October 1980. On 24 September, Bonham was picked up by Led Zeppelin assistant Rex King to attend rehearsals at Bray Studios. During the journey, Bonham asked to stop for breakfast, where he downed four quadruple vodkas (450 ml/15 oz.), with a ham roll. After taking a bite of the ham roll he said to his assistant, ""breakfast"". He continued to drink heavily after arriving at the studio. The rehearsals were halted late that evening and the band retired to Page's house--the Old Mill House in Clewer, Windsor. After midnight, Bonham, who had fallen asleep, was taken to bed and placed on his side. At 1:45 pm the next day, Benji LeFevre (Led Zeppelin's new tour manager) and John Paul Jones found Bonham dead. The cause of death was asphyxiation from vomit; an autopsy found no other drugs in his body. Bonham was cremated on 10 October 1980, and his ashes were buried in the graveyard of St Michael's Church in Rushock near Droitwich, Worcestershire. A verdict of accidental death was returned at an inquest held on 27 October. 
The planned North American tour was cancelled, and despite rumours that Cozy Powell, Carmine Appice, Barriemore Barlow, Simon Kirke, or Bev Bevan would join the group as his replacement, the remaining members decided to disband. A 4 December 1980 press statement stated that, ""We wish it to be known that the loss of our dear friend, and the deep sense of undivided harmony felt by ourselves and our manager, have led us to decide that we could not continue as we were"". The statement was signed simply ""Led Zeppelin"". 

Post-breakup:

1980s:

Following the dissolution of Led Zeppelin, the first significant project for the band members was the Honeydrippers, which Plant initially formed in 1981, and which released its only album in 1984. The group featured Page on lead guitar, along with studio musicians and friends of Plant and Page, including Jeff Beck, Paul Shaffer, and Nile Rodgers. Plant focused the band in a different direction from Led Zeppelin, playing standards and in a more R&B style, highlighted by their cover of ""Sea of Love"", which peaked at number three on the Billboard charts in early 1985. 
Coda, which was a collection of outtakes and unused tracks from the band's career, was released in November 1982. It included two tracks taken from the band's performance at the Royal Albert Hall in 1970, one each from the Led Zeppelin III and Houses of the Holy sessions, and three from the In Through the Out Door sessions. It also featured a 1976 Bonham drum instrumental with electronic effects added by Page, called ""Bonzo's Montreux"". 
On 13 July 1985, Page, Plant, and Jones reunited for the Live Aid concert at JFK Stadium, Philadelphia, playing a short set featuring drummers Tony Thompson and Phil Collins and bassist Paul Martinez. Collins had contributed to Plant's first two solo albums while Martinez was a member of Plant's group Band of Joy. The performance was marred by the lack of rehearsal with the two drummers, Page's struggles with an out-of-tune guitar, poorly functioning monitors, and by Plant's hoarse voice. Page described the performance as ""pretty shambolic"", while Plant characterised it as an ""atrocity"". 
The three members reunited again on 14 May 1988, for the Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary concert, with Bonham's son, Jason Bonham, on drums. The result was another disjointed performance, after Plant and Page had argued immediately prior to coming on stage about whether to play ""Stairway to Heaven"", and with the complete loss of Jones' keyboards on the live television feed. Page described the performance as ""one big disappointment"", and Plant said that ""the gig was foul"". 

1990s:

The first Led Zeppelin box set, featuring tracks remastered under Page's supervision, was released in 1990 and bolstered the band's reputation, leading to abortive discussions among members about a reunion. This set included four previously unreleased tracks, including a version of Robert Johnson's ""Travelling Riverside Blues"". The song peaked at number seven on the Billboard Album Rock Tracks chart. 1992 saw the release of the ""Immigrant Song""/""Hey Hey What Can I Do"" (the original B-side) as a CD single in the US.Led Zeppelin Boxed Set 2 was released in 1993; the two box sets together containing all known studio recordings, as well as some rare live tracks. 
In 1994, Page and Plant reunited for a 90-minute ""UnLedded"" MTV project. They later released an album called No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded, which featured some reworked Led Zeppelin songs, and embarked on a world tour the following year. This is said to be the beginning of a rift between the band members, as Jones was not even told of the reunion. 
In 1995, Led Zeppelin were inducted into the United States Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Steven Tyler and Joe Perry of Aerosmith. Jason and Zoë Bonham also attended, representing their late father. At the induction ceremony, the band's inner rift became apparent when Jones joked upon accepting his award, ""Thank you, my friends, for finally remembering my phone number"", causing consternation and awkward looks from Page and Plant. Afterwards, they played one brief set with Tyler and Perry, with Jason Bonham on drums, and then a second with Neil Young, this time with Michael Lee playing the drums. 
In 1997, Atlantic released a single edit of ""Whole Lotta Love"" in the US and the UK, the only single the band released in their homeland, where it peaked at number 21. November 1997 saw the release of Led Zeppelin BBC Sessions, a two-disc set largely recorded in 1969 and 1971. Page and Plant released another album called Walking into Clarksdale in 1998, featuring all new material, but after disappointing sales the partnership dissolved before a planned Australian tour. 

2000s and beyond:

2003 saw the release of the triple live album How the West Was Won, and Led Zeppelin DVD, a six-hour chronological set of live footage that became the best-selling music DVD in history. In July 2007 Atlantic/Rhino and Warner Home Video announced three new Led Zeppelin titles to be released that November. First was Mothership, a 24-track best-of spanning the band's career, followed by a reissue of the soundtrack The Song Remains the Same, which included previously unreleased material, and a new DVD. Led Zeppelin also made their catalogue legally available for digital download, becoming one of the last major rock bands to do so. 
On 10 December 2007, Led Zeppelin reunited for the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert at the O2 Arena in London, with Jason Bonham again taking his late father's place on drums. According to Guinness World Records 2009, Led Zeppelin set the world record for the ""Highest Demand for Tickets for One Music Concert"" as 20 million requests for the reunion show were rendered online. Music critics praised the band's performance and there was widespread speculation about a full reunion. Page, Jones and Jason Bonham were reported to be willing to tour, and to be working on material for a new Led Zeppelin project. Plant continued his touring commitments with Alison Krauss, stating in September 2008 that he would not be recording or touring with the band. Jones and Page reportedly looked for a replacement for Plant, considering singers including Steven Tyler, and Myles Kennedy of Alter Bridge, but in January 2009 it was confirmed that the project had been abandoned. A film of the O2 performance, Celebration Day, premiered on 17 October 2012 and was released on home video on 19 November. The film grossed $2 million in one night, and the live album peaked at number 4 and 9 in the UK and US, respectively. Following the film's premiere, Page revealed that he had been remastering the band's discography with the first three albums re-released on 2 June 2014, containing bonus tracks. 

Musical style:

Led Zeppelin's music was rooted in the blues. The influence of American blues artists such as Muddy Waters and Skip James was particularly apparent on their first two albums, as was the distinct country blues style of Howlin' Wolf. Tracks were structured around the twelve-bar blues on every studio album except for one, and the blues directly and indirectly influenced other songs both musically and lyrically. The band were also strongly influenced by the music of the British, Celtic, and American folk revivals. Scottish folk guitarist Bert Jansch helped inspire Page, and from him he adapted open tunings and aggressive strokes into his playing. The band also drew on a wide variety of genres, including world music, and elements of early rock and roll, jazz, country, funk, soul, and reggae, particularly on Houses of the Holy and the albums that followed. 
The material on the first two albums was largely constructed out of extended jams of blues standards and folk songs. This method led to the mixing of musical and lyrical elements of different songs and versions, as well as improvised passages, to create new material, but would lead to later accusations of plagiarism and legal disputes over copyright. Usually the music was developed first, sometimes with improvised lyrics that might then be rewritten for the final version of the song. From the visit to Bron-Yr-Aur in 1970, the songwriting partnership between Page and Plant became predominant, with Page supplying the music, largely via his acoustic guitar, and Plant emerging as the band's chief lyricist. Jones and Bonham then added to the material, in rehearsal or in the studio, as a song was developed. In the later stages of the band's career, Page took a back seat in composition and Jones became increasingly important in producing music, often composed on the keyboard. Plant would then add lyrics before Page and Bonham developed their parts. 

Early lyrics drew on the band's blues and folk roots, often mixing lyrical fragments from different songs. Many of the band's songs dealt with themes of romance, unrequited love and sexual conquest, which were common in rock, pop and blues music. Some of their lyrics, especially those derived from the blues, have been interpreted as misogynistic. Particularly on Led Zeppelin III, they incorporated elements of mythology and mysticism into their music, which largely grew out of Plant's interest in legends and history. These elements were often taken to reflect Page's interest in the occult, which resulted in accusations that the recordings contained subliminal satanic messages, some of which were said to be contained in backmasking; these claims were generally dismissed by the band and music critics. Susan Fast argues that as Plant emerged as the band's main lyricist, the songs more obviously reflected his alignment with the West Coast counterculture of the 1960s. In the later part of the band's career Plant's lyrics became more autobiographical, and less optimistic, drawing on his own experiences and circumstances. 
According to musicologist Robert Walser, ""Led Zeppelin's sound was marked by speed and power, unusual rhythmic patterns, contrasting terraced dynamics, singer Robert Plant's wailing vocals, and guitarist Jimmy Page's heavily distorted crunch"". These elements mean that they are often cited as one of the progenitors of hard rock and heavy metal and they have been described as the ""definitive heavy metal band"", although the band members have often eschewed the label. Part of this reputation depends on the band's use of distorted guitar riffs on songs like ""Whole Lotta Love"" and ""The Wanton Song"". Often riffs were not doubled by guitar, bass and drums exactly, but instead there were melodic or rhythmic variations; as in ""Black Dog"", where three different time signatures are used. Page's guitar playing incorporated elements of the blues scale with those of eastern music. Plant's use of high-pitched shrieks has been compared to Janis Joplin's vocal technique. Bonham's drumming was noted for its power, his rapid rolls and his fast beats on a single bass drum. Jones' basslines have been described as melodic and his keyboard playing added a classical touch to the band's sound. 
Page stated that he wanted Led Zeppelin to produce music that had ""light and shade"". This began to be more clearly realised beginning with Led Zeppelin III, which made greater use of acoustic instruments. This approach has been seen as exemplified in the fourth album, particularly on ""Stairway to Heaven"", which begins with acoustic guitar and recorder and ends with drums and heavy electric sounds. Towards the end of their recording career, they moved to a more mellow and progressive sound, dominated by Jones' keyboard motifs. They also increasingly made use of various layering and production techniques, including multi-tracking and overdubbed guitar parts. Their emphasis on the sense of dynamics and ensemble arrangement has been seen as producing an individualistic style that transcends any single music genre. Ian Peddie argues that they were ""... loud, powerful and often heavy, but their music was also humorous, self-reflective and extremely subtle"". 

Legacy:

Led Zeppelin are widely considered to be one of the most successful, innovative, and influential rock bands in the history of music. Rock critic Mikal Gilmore said, ""Led Zeppelin--talented, complex, grasping, beautiful and dangerous--made one of the most enduring bodies of composition and performance in twentieth-century music, despite everything they had to overpower, including themselves"". 
Led Zeppelin have influenced hard rock and heavy metal bands such as Deep Purple,Black Sabbath,Rush,Queen, and Megadeth as well as progressive metal bands like Tool and Dream Theater. They influenced some early punk and post-punk bands, among them the Ramones and the Cult. They were also an important influence on the development of alternative rock, as bands adapted elements from the ""Zeppelin sound"" of the mid-1970s, including the Smashing Pumpkins,Nirvana,Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden. Bands and artists from diverse genres have acknowledged the influence of Led Zeppelin, such as Madonna,Shakira,Lady Gaga, and Katie Melua. 

Led Zeppelin have been credited with a major impact on the nature of the music business, particularly in the development of album-orientated rock (AOR) and stadium rock. In 1988 John Kalodner, then-A&R executive of Geffen Records, remarked that ""In my opinion, next to the Beatles they're the most influential band in history. They influence the way music is on records, AOR radio, concerts. They set the standards for the AOR-radio format with 'Stairway to Heaven,' having AOR hits without necessarily having Top 40 hits. They're the ones who did the first real big arena concert shows, consistently selling out and playing stadiums without support. People can do as well as them, but nobody surpasses them"".Andrew Loog Oldham, the former producer and manager of the Rolling Stones, commented on how Led Zeppelin had a major influence on the record business, and the way rock concerts were managed and presented to huge audiences. 
The band have sold over 200 million albums worldwide according to some sources, while others state that they have sold in excess of 300 million records, including 111.5 million certified units in the United States. According to the Recording Industry Association of America, Led Zeppelin are the second-highest-selling band, the fourth highest selling music act in the US, and one of only three acts to earn four or more Diamond albums. Led Zeppelin remain one of the most bootlegged artists in the history of rock music. 
Led Zeppelin also made a significant cultural impact. Jim Miller, editor of Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll, argues that ""on one level, Led Zeppelin represents the final flowering of the sixties' psychedelic ethic, which casts rock as passive sensory involvement"". Led Zeppelin have also been described as ""the quintessential purveyors"" of masculine and aggressive ""cock rock"", although this assertion has been challenged. The band's fashion-sense has been seminal; Simeon Lipman, head of pop culture at Christie's auction house, has commented that ""Led Zeppelin have had a big influence on fashion because the whole aura surrounding them is so cool, and people want a piece of that"". Led Zeppelin laid the foundation for the big hair of 1980s glam metal bands such as Mötley Crüe and Skid Row. Other musicians have also adapted elements from Led Zeppelin's attitude to clothes, jewellery and hair, such as the hipster flares and tight band T-shirts of Kings of Leon, shaggy hair, clingy T-shirts and bluesman hair of Jack White of the White Stripes, and Kasabian guitarist Sergio Pizzorno's silk scarves, trilbies and side-laced tight jeans. 

Awards and accolades:

Led Zeppelin have collected many honours and awards throughout the course of their career. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006. Among the band's awards are an American Music Award in 2005, and the Polar Music Prize in 2006. Led Zeppelin were the recipient of a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005, and four of their recordings have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. They have been awarded five Diamond albums, as well as fourteen Multi-Platinum, four Platinum and one Gold album in the United States, while in the UK they have five Multi-Platinum, six Platinum, one Gold and four Silver albums. In addition to listing five of their albums among ""the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time"", Rolling Stone named Led Zeppelin the 14th-greatest artist of all time in 2004. 
In 2005, Page was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in recognition of his charity work, and in 2009 Plant was honoured as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his services to popular music. The band are ranked number one on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock and Classic Rock‍ '​s ""50 best live acts of all time"". They were named as the best Rock band in a poll by BBC Radio 2. They were awarded an Ivor Novello Award for ""Outstanding Contribution to British Music"" in 1977, as well as a ""Lifetime Achievement Award"" at the 42nd Annual Ivor Novello awards ceremony in 1997. The band were honoured at the 2008 MOJO Awards with the ""Best Live Act"" prize for their one-off reunion, and were described as the ""greatest rock and roll band of all time"". The three surviving members (Page, Plant, and Jones) were named as 2012 recipients of Kennedy Center Honors.]",0.312420613637,0.878615,"[rock, classic rock, blues-rock, album rock, hard rock]",0.868477,0.011671667929,0.37024209526,0.616991837873,0.720515655927,0.0100982802977,5.0,0.896662556815,0.774573341975,0.0,0.0580068808499,0.728887702031,3.0,0.340161109143,1

Destroyer songs are characterized by abstract, poetic lyrics and idiosyncratic vocals. The band's discography draws on a variety of musical influences, resulting in albums that can sound markedly distinct from one another; in Bejar's words, ""That's kind of my goal: to start from scratch every time.""  

Career:

1996--2001:
We'll Build Them a Golden Bridge, Destroyer's 1996 debut, is made up of sixteen lo-fi home-recordings. One reviewer suggested that the album combines Bejar's ""gift for melodies"" with ""a concerted effort to make the recording downright inconsumable; the guitars are always out of tune, and the vocals of Fisher-Price quality. 'Static means punk / tuning is junk,' Bejar moans on one track.""  (Ideas for Songs, released on cassette in 1997, features songs akin to those on his first album. The cassette stemmed from a request to contribute songs for a compilation album.) 
As Bejar gained popularity in Vancouver's music scene, he was joined by producer John Collins for 1998's City of Daughters, which was recorded at a proper studio.Pitchfork noted that the songs still sounded ""homespun,"" also noting ""the wordiness that would become something of a trademark is in full effect,"" but that ""unlike much of what came later, not every line is worthy of examination."" 
Thief (2000) embodied ""Bejar's first stab at matching his grandiose, idiosyncratic vision to a showier sound;"" it was the first to feature a backing band on every track. The record's ""anthemic yet understated"" piano-driven ballads have characteristically enigmatic lyrics, though some reviewers interpreted them as critiques of the music industry. 
Streethawk: A Seduction (2001) realized the sonic refinement started with City of Daughters. Bejar put it this way: ""I don't think it gives credence to any kind of conceptualization of the records, but I hope that City of Daughters, Thief, and Streethawk will pop into some kind of a progression that ends with Streethawk.""  A critical success, the album (retrospectively) received a rating of 9.1/10 from Pitchfork. 

2002--2007:
The 2002 rock album This Night was a dramatic change in style, a ""foil to the sleek and streamlined approach of earlier recordings."" The looser, less rehearsed style was criticized as ""messy and haphazard without purpose,"" though other critics praised the ""beautiful mess of sounds"" as ""challenging... and a powerful, cohesive whole."" In a 2006 interview (after the release of Your Blues and Destroyer's Rubies), Bejar said the album ""came together pretty quickly - we probably could have used more than four or five days to mix the whole thing, but that's all hindsight. It's still my favorite Destroyer record."" 
Your Blues (2004) saw Destroyer take another unexpected turn, using MIDI instrumentation for almost all the backing music. Bejar coined the term ""European blues"" to describe its unique, theatrical sound. One reviewer pointed out that ""Bejar's unusual voice sounds more confident, and higher up"" in the synth-rich arrangements. In yet another twist, the EP Notorious Lightning & Other Works reworked six tracks from the record with a live band, the very thing the LP had forsaken (the band was Frog Eyes, who toured with Destroyer in support of Your Blues). 
Bejar returned with a live band for 2006's Destroyer's Rubies, delivering arguably his most confident record up to that point. The backing band took new-found prominence and, according to Bejar, ""the production seems... warm and lush and pretty focused on just making the band sound good and having everything sit well together.""NOW Magazine observed, ""while the sheer density of Bejar's writing can be overwhelming, Destroyer's Rubies is, on a musical level, the most 'accessible' disc he's released."" 

2008--2013:
For Trouble in Dreams (2008), ""there was a scary lack of ideas coming into the record,"" Bejar admitted. Destroyer's piano player Ted Bois took it upon himself, as an alternative to keyboard and piano accompaniment, to create all string and synth arrangements for the songs. At the time, Bejar said it was the ""hardest record"" to make. 
After the 2009 EP Bay of Pigs came 2011's full-length album, Kaputt (featuring a slightly modified ""Bay of Pigs"" track). Bejar cited influences such as Miles Davis and Roxy Music for his new jazz-infused, lounge music-inspired, sophisti-pop direction. In multiple interviews, Bejar variously stressed that he ""sang in a completely different manner, almost unconscious of even singing, more like speaking into a vacuum, and was really happy with the results."" The record entailed a number of firsts for Destroyer: first national television performance (on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon); first official music video; first female backing vocals; and the first time Bejar performed without an instrument on tour - his concentration placed solely on his singing. Kaputt was short listed for the 2011 Polaris Music Prize  and was Pitchfork's second best album of 2011. 
Although smaller in scale, Destroyer's fourth EP ""Five Spanish Songs"" continued to surprise listeners. Sung entirely in Spanish, Bejar covered songs by Sr. Chinarro (es). Bejar's own tongue-in-cheek press release announcing the new songs began: ""It was 2013. The English language seemed spent, despicable, not easily singable."" 

2014--Present:
Bejar will release his newest album, Poison Season August 28, 2015. Bejar notes that the album's sound grew from ""just really getting into what we were sounding like playing live following Kaputt.""  

Band Name:
In 2002, Bejar said about the band name, ""I kind of wanted to go for a rock 'n' roll name. In our own special way we're tearing shit apart, you just have to listen very carefully. Musically I knew it was never going to be a metal band, but I thought lyrically there were fangs to the music."" Bejar added in 2008, ""I was actually so out of it I didn't know that there was a Kiss record called Destroyer because I didn't know anything about Kiss. I still don't know anything about them. I just thought it was a cool rock-and-roll name, and I was kind of blown away that it hadn't been taken already. I was like, 'I have to use this because it's so weird that no one's used it before.'"" 

Collaborators:
The ever-evolving lineup can give the impression that Destroyer is a solo project. However, Bejar has insisted ""the music is always collaborative and I think that gets lost in the weird cult of personality shit that seems to get whipped up around me."" Although Bejar had claimed that the lineup from certain recording sessions would be permanent, later recording sessions and tours added and dropped musicians. Several band members have the commonality of being from the production team of JC/DC (John Collins and David Carswell). 
Some songs recorded for Your Blues originated from Bejar's musical contribution to Sheila Heti's play All Our Happy Days Are Stupid. 
On the EP Archer on the Beach (2010), Bejar worked with ambient-music composer Tim Hecker for the title track. Bejar wrote in the press release: ""The reason why this has to be seen as a collaboration, rather than strictly a Destroyer release, is that, for the first time, I'm not responsible for any of the music ... aside from the vocals, the general chord progression."" On the B-side, the spoken word song ""Grief Point,"" Loscil provided the music. (Loscil also composed an extra track, ""Loscil's Rubies,"" on the vinyl version of Destroyer's Rubies.) 
American visual artist Kara Walker contributed to the lyrics for Kaputt's ""Suicide Demo (For Kara Walker)."" Organized by Merge, Walker sent cue cards with bits of text to Bejar in 2009.

The current lineup of Dirty Projectors is Dave Longstreth (vocals, multiple instruments), Amber Coffman (vocals, guitar), Nat Baldwin (bass), Mike Johnson (drums), Olga Bell (vocals, keyboard) and Haley Dekle (vocals). Angel Deradoorian (vocals, keyboard) went on an indefinite hiatus from the band in 2012.  Based in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn with connections to the Portland, OR music scene, the group has produced a distinctive sound of electronic experimentation, melded with traditional instruments and harmonically complex vocals. Their recordings range from Prince-style one-man-recording-studio productions (The Glad Fact), to arranged orchestrations (the ""Slaves' Graves"" half of Slaves' Graves & Ballads), to basic voice over nylon-string guitar (the ""Ballads"" half of the aforementioned) to an amalgamation of all these tactics (the 'glitch opera' of The Getty Address and the mixed nature of New Attitude EP). Throughout, Longstreth's aggressively melodic vocals provide a consistent identity for otherwise widely divergent approaches to pop music. Longstreth claims influences ranging from Don Henley to Mariah Carey. The former's influence is most easily seen in The Getty Address album, which is a conceptual opera written from the point of view of Henley as a Spanish Conquistador, though the latter's vocal gymnastics clearly provide a clue to Longstreth's approach. Longstreth's latest album, Rise Above, is an attempt to re-imagine the lyrics of Black Flag's Damaged album from memory over complex music that sees influence from the contemporary African blues and funk of such artists as Ali Farka Toure and Konono No. 1.   http://westernvinyl.com/dirty_projectors.htm, Dirty Projectors are the project of Dave Longstreth, a former ..., MANAGEMENT:Jake Friedman (jake@dirtyprojectors.net)PRESS INQUIRIES:U.S.: Judy Silverman @ Motormouth Media (judy@motormouthmedia.com)(323) ..., The brainchild of wilfully eclectic Brooklyn-based performer David Longstreth, Dirty ..., Dirty Projectors are the project of Dave Longstreth, a former ..., _DISCOGRAPHY_ THE GLAD FACT [Western Vinyl, 2003] ""The Glad Fact"" ..., The brainchild of willfully eclectic Brooklyn-based performer David Longstreth, Dirty ..., Dirty Projectors are the project of Dave Longstreth, a former ..., Over three full lengths, an EP, and five different live ..., Dave Longstreth

Dirty Projectors performing in 2008

Dirty Projectors are an American musical group, consisting of David Longstreth (vocals, guitar), Amber Coffman (vocals, guitar), Haley Dekle (vocals), Nat Baldwin (bass), Olga Bell (vocals, keyboards), and Michael Johnson (drums). They have released seven full-length albums. 

History:

Early years and Rise Above (2002-07):
Longstreth's first album, The Graceful Fallen Mango, was released in 2002 under his own name and introduced his distinctive use of song arrangements and his combination of lo-fi and hi-fi production. The album was a project that Longstreth began as a freshman while studying at Yale University. With the help of Adam Forkner of Yume Bitsu, Longstreth recorded and released The Glad Fact on the Western Vinyl label under the name ""The Dirty Projectors."" In 2005, the band released The Getty Address, a concept album about musician Don Henley that features extensive orchestral and choral accompaniment. The diverse, stripped-down New Attitude EP followed in 2006 and featured inklings of the band's later vocal interplay and guitar work. 
In 2007, the band released Rise Above, an album of Black Flag songs as re-imagined from memory. The album introduced the band's distinctive contrast between Longstreth's vocals and the harmonies of Amber Coffman and Susanna Waiche, who was later replaced by Angel Deradoorian. In support of the album, the band performed songs for a Take-Away Show acoustic video session shot by Vincent Moon. 

Domino Records, Bitte Orca, and Mount Wittenberg Orca (2008-11):
In April 2008, Dirty Projectors signed with Domino Records, and the label announced the release of their fifth full-length album, Bitte Orca, for June 9, 2009. That year, the band also collaborated with David Byrne on the song ""Knotty Pine"" for the compilation album Dark Was the Night produced by the Red Hot Organization. Byrne joined the Dirty Projectors onstage to perform this song, along with ""Ambulance Man,"" another collaborative track not included on the compilation, at the ""Dark Was the Night Live"" concert at New York City's Radio City Music Hall on May 3, 2009. 
""Stillness Is the Move"" was the first single released from Bitte Orca, a West African - R&B influenced hybrid, sung by Coffman and inspired by the Wim Wenders film Wings of Desire.Bitte Orca was met with positive reviews, including Rolling Stone magazine rating the album as number 6 on their best 25 albums of 2009. 
Dirty Projectors were to release a new EP in September 2009 titled Temecula Sunrise. While the EP was never released, two of its tracks, ""Ascending Melody"" and ""Emblem of the World,"" were instead offered for free download on the Dirty Projectors website in early 2010. 
On May 8, 2009, members of Dirty Projectors collaborated with Björk to perform an original composition by Longstreth, written for five voices and acoustic guitar, as part of a charity concert to benefit Housing Works, a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing shelter for homeless men, women, and children suffering from AIDS. The concert was held at the Housing Works Bookstore & Café in downtown New York City. On June 30, 2010, Dirty Projectors announced the release of Mount Wittenberg Orca, a digital-only EP with Björk based on the artists' collaboration.Mount Wittenberg Orca was released physically by Domino Records in 2011. 

Swing Lo Magellan (2012-present):
On March 30, 2012, Dirty Projectors released the first single from their upcoming album, Swing Lo Magellan, ""Gun Has No Trigger"". The album was released on July 10 in the United States and on July 9 internationally. 
In September 2012, Dave Longstreth released a short film called ""Hi Custodian"". 
On November 6, 2012, Dirty Projectors released About to Die EP, a digital- and vinyl-release EP featuring several new tracks. 

Musical style and aesthetics:
While often associated with the late 2000s New York indie rock scene, critics have likened Dirty Projectors to musicians from many genres.

As a songwriting teenager during a time when Guided by Voices and Brainiac were packing local bars and three of The Breeders were still in town, Wennerstrom used to sneak into clubs to check out the scene. ""I would just see those people--my music heroes--hanging out at the bar like everyone else,"" she remembers. ""I could see myself in them. It gave me inspiration to do my own thing.""  After doing the usual business of playing local shows, the trio set out the following year on a regional tour. One of the first gigs of the trip took them to a bar in Akron, where The Black Keys' drummer Patrick Carney just happened to be one of only a handful of people in the audience. This chance encounter led Wennerstrom and the Heartless Bastards to Fat Possum Records, with whom they released their debut, Stairs and Elevators, in early 2005.  The band moved on with critical praise in their back pocket, including a four-and-a-half star review from Rolling Stone, which took note that, when Wennerstrom ""opens her throat on Stairs and Elevators ... she sounds like she's wailing on the shoulders of giants; her sad and angry vocals channeling all the swagger and spit of a young Robert Plant""  By whatever yardstick you care to measure, it was high time for Erika to get out of Dayton.  In true ascetic discipline, she moved to Austin, Texas in 2007 for a change of inspirational scenery and a new recording project. With the help of producer Mike McCarthy (Spoon, Trail of Dead), she assembled a group of musicians with whom she gave the songs life and uncovered yet another layer of Wennerstrom and the Heartless Bastards. Two of the new Bastards aren't Texas ringers, but fellow Dayton brethren Dave Colvin on drums, and Jesse Ebaugh on bass, who actually played on the original demo that hooked Fat Possum, throw in one Austin native on guitar, Mark Nathan and you've got a new unstoppable force that ""Take the stage and literally knock everybody down"" - NY Times review of the Bastards SxSW record release performance.  The Decemberists' guitarist Chris Funk said, ""It's been a few years since I've had a voice on repeat in my mind. This voice seems to arrive in my ears while sound checking, often before the shows on a pre-show play list and after shows too -- the songs are just perfect and the band has found their spots behind this incredible woman. A unique and enduring artist arrived into our world once again.""  The album, entitled The Mountain, (released February 2009) delivers the powerful howl that fans expect from the Heartless Bastards, but also weaves in adventure with mandolins, banjos, strings and Erika's transcendent voice.  Brimming with confidence and creativity, The album Arrow (released February 2012) sees Heartless Bastards pushing their distinctive sound forward with their most eclectic, energetic collection thus far.  The album - the Austin, Texas-based band's first release with Partisan Records - is marked as ever by singer/guitarist/songwriter Erika Wennerstrom's remarkable voice, at turns primal and pleading, heartfelt and heroic.  Songs like ""Parted Ways"" and the searing ""Low Low Low"" expertly capture the Bastards' multi-dimensional rock in all its strength and spirit.  Following upon the difficult introspection of 2009′s acclaimed third album, The Mountain, Arrow stands as a powerhouse new beginning for Heartless Bastards.

History:
Heartless Bastards originally formed as a four-piece band with members Erika Wennerstrom on vocals, piano and guitar, Dave Colvin on drums, Adam McAllister on bass and Michael Weinel on lead guitar. They played their first live show at The Comet, a bar in the Cincinnati community of Northside, in August 2003. After parting ways with Colvin, McAllister and Weinel, Wennerstrom reformed the group as a three piece with Kevin Vaughn on drums and Mike Lamping on bass. The band was signed to Fat Possum Records in 2004 after Patrick Carney from The Black Keys passed along a demo he received from Erika. The 5-song demo was recorded in December 2002 at Ultrasuede Studios by Shannon McGee and featured Colvin on drums, along with contributions from Reuben Glaser on lead guitar and Jesse Ebaugh on bass. 
Rolling Stone reviewed their debut album Stairs and Elevators and said, ""the Heartless Bastards are a small-town band who are ready to show the big city no mercy"".The Village Voice wrote: ""deadeye accurate in pitch and message... what we've got is a hard, gnarled voice singing simple-seeming melodies that feel archetypal rather than ordinary, which is no easier to explain than it is to do"". Stylus gave the group high praise, stating, ""(Erika Wennerstrom) and her two band mates have created an album with more rocking songs and fat hooks than most bands can dream of. It's not just that they rock, it's that you believe what you hear, that they love the sound they make, that Wennerstrom lays her soul bare in her lyrics without sounding like Sarah McLachlan, that the women of rock who labored to make it OK for a girl to dream of playing guitar deserve far better than Avril Lavigne or Kelly Osbourne as their descendants."" 
The second full-length album from the band, All This Time, was released on August 8, 2006. The band road tested many of the tracks on the record prior to releasing it and received rave reviews from audiences. The album relies less on guitar riffs and belted vocals and more on musicianship, without leaving behind the group's unique sound. On the modern rock station WOXY, the band was ranked No. 12 on the 97 Best of 2005, putting the band among the likes of Spoon and ahead of blues rockers The White Stripes. 
According to Wennerstrom, the name of the band comes from a question on a Mega Touch trivia quiz game at a bar. A question asked the name of Tom Petty's backing band, and one of the options was ""Tom Petty and the Heartless Bastards"". She thought it was funny, and used it when she later formed a band. 
In August 2008, a new line-up for the band was announced. Erika Wennerstrom remains the only constant member, rejoined by bassist Jesse Ebaugh and original Heartless Bastards drummer Dave Colvin. 
Their third album The Mountain was released February 3, 2009 on Fat Possum Records and was produced by Spoon producer Mike McCarthy. For this album the band broadened their sound to include elements of country music, employing violin, banjo, mandolin and steel guitar. 
Heartless Bastards performed a taping for the PBS series Austin City Limits on June 3, 2009 as part of the show's 35th anniversary season. In October and November 2009 the band opened for Wolfmother during the band's American tour. 

Current line-up:
On November 17, 2011, Heartless Bastards announced they had signed with Brooklyn based Partisan Records to release their fourth album Arrow on February 14, 2012. On December 15, 2011, the band announced on Twitter that the pre-order for Arrow was launched, and that fans could get a limited edition lithograph by preordering.Arrow was produced by Spoon drummer Jim Eno at his Public Hi-Fi Home studio in Austin, Texas. It features the current line-up of Erika Wennerstrom (vocals/guitar), Jesse Ebaugh (bass), Dave Colvin (drums) and Mark Nathan (guitar). 
In Billboard's November 17, 2011 album announcement, Wennerstrom explained: ""I feel like this is the strongest record I've ever done. I feel like playing with these guys, us all being so connected, really helped make it so fully realized. I'm really, really happy with it"". 
On December 1, 2011, the first single from Arrow called ""Parted Ways"" was released exclusively on RollingStone.com and to the band's fans.

In Spring 2015, Auerbach announced a new side-project, The Arcs. The group will release their debut album, ""Yours Dreamily"", on September 4, 2015. 

Childhood and early life:
Auerbach was born in Ohio, and is the son of Mary Little (née Quine; b. about 1948), a teacher of French, and Charles Auerbach (b. about 1950), an antique dealer. His father is of Polish Jewish descent and his mother is of part Manx descent. His maternal cousin, twice removed, was philosopher and logician Willard Van Orman Quine, and his second cousin once removed was the late guitarist Robert Quine. Auerbach grew up in a family with musical roots. Auerbach became infatuated with blues after listening to his father's old vinyl records during his childhood, his first concert was Whitney Houston with his mother at the Blossom Music Center in Cuyahoga Falls, OH. His second concert was a Grateful Dead show with his father at the Richfield Coliseum in Cleveland. He was influenced early-on by his mother's side of the family, notably his uncles who played bluegrass music. 
Auerbach described himself as a normal teenager in high school who smoked marijuana and captained the soccer team at Firestone High School. He was heavily influenced by Junior Kimbrough in college, eventually resulting in his dropping out to pursue the guitar more seriously. ""I've listened to him so much, it's just how I hear it... I studied him so much... Getting F's in college, when I should've been studying, I was listening to Junior Kimbrough's music instead"". Other major influences include: Robert Johnson, R.L. Burnside, Clarence White, Robert Nighthawk, T-Model Ford, Hound Dog Taylor, Mississippi Fred McDowell, Kokomo Arnold, Son House and RZA of the Wu Tang Clan. 

Performances and bands:

The Barnburners:
Auerbach was a member of a band called The Barnburners before forming The Black Keys in 2001. The Barnburners included Auerbach, Jason Edwards and Kip Amore. The Barnburners were a blues-based band that performed in Northeast Ohio clubs and released a 6 track album called The Rawboogie EP. The album includes the Junior Kimbrough song ""Meet Me in the City"", which Auerbach later covered with The Black Keys on their Chulahoma studio album. 

The Fast Five:
The band ""Fast Five"" toured with Auerbach in 2009. The Fast Five's other members drew from the band Hacienda and percussionist Patrick Hallahan from My Morning Jacket. The original percussionist, Bob Cesare, was unable to perform with the Fast Five because of a death in his family. 
Dan and fellow Black Keys member Patrick Carney met the members of Hacienda at a club, Emo's, in Austin, Texas while watching a band during the Austin City Limits Music Festival. Upon seeing one of the Hacienda band members hit on an intoxicated woman, Carney walked over and leaned in saying, ""Dude, trust me, that's a bad idea."" After becoming acquainted with each other, Dan e-mailed Hacienda a month later asking for more demos, which eventually led them to being asked to open for The Black Keys and Dr. Dog at a show in Austin, Texas. Afterward, Auerbach asked Hacienda to travel to Akron, Ohio where they would be his ""guinea pigs"" while recording Keep It Hid. 

Awards and honors:
At the 2013 Grammy Awards, Auerbach won the award for Producer of the Year, Non-Classical. 
In 2010, he joined the 9th annual Independent Music Awards judging panel to assist independent musicians' careers. 

Personal life:
Auerbach was married to Stephanie Gonis, with whom he has a daughter, Sadie Little Auerbach, born in 2008.

Beck's music is known for its pop-junk culture collage of musical styles, ironic lyrics, samples, drum machines, live instrumentation and heady sound effects.  Beck was born in Los Angeles, California, to David Campbell (a musician and son of a Presbyterian minister) and Bibbe Hansen (a former dancer for The Velvet Underground, founding member of the satirical band Black Fag, and visual artist). When his parents separated, Beck stayed with his mother and brother in Los Angeles, where he was influenced by that city's diverse musical offerings--everything from hip-hop to latin music--and his mother's art scene - all of which would later reappear in his recorded and published work.  Although Beck's work defies easy description, his eclecticism and genre experiments have sparked comparisons with Prince, though Beck was undoubtedly a less prolific artist, and drew on an absurdist, free-flowing lyrical style totally original when first exposed to mainstream audiences (indeed, some critics labeled him and his breakthrough single Loser as novelties - see below). Despite this individualism, Beck's music was very much a product of the 90s and the media age in general, with hip hop, indie/underground rock, electronic music and genre-benders like the Beastie Boys as notable touchstones; in addition, some critics could not resist likening his head-spinning lyrical aesthetic to a post-modern Bob Dylan sensibility.  After dropping out of high school in the mid-1980s, Beck educated himself and traveled widely. In Germany, he spent time with his grandfather, fluxus artist Al Hansen. His artistic relationship with his grandfather may have influenced both his album art and sense of musical collage. He began the musical activity in 1988. The late-80's found him in New York City as part of the punk-influenced anti-folk music movement.  Beck returned to Los Angeles at the turn of the decade, destitute but motivated. During this time, Beck sought out (or snuck onto) stages at venues all over Los Angeles, from punk clubs to coffee shops. Some of his earliest and most thought-provoking recordings were achieved by working with Tom Grimley at Poop Alley Studios, a part of Win Records.  In this atmosphere of heady creativity the founders of Bong Load Custom Records discovered Beck. Their 1993 12"" vinyl Loser, from an initial run of 530 copies, created a sensation on college and alternative radio that led to a furious bidding war between labels to sign Beck. Eventually, he chose Geffen Records, who offered him terms that included an allowance for the release of independent albums while under contract (he may have owed Bong Load another album or two).  In 1994, Geffen's official debut release of Mellow Gold made Beck a mainstream smash success; it also led to his iconic status as the ""slacker"" representative of the alternative rock scene, although the title of the song had been ironic.  At the same time, he released Stereopathetic Soulmanure on Flipside Records and One Foot In The Grave on independent K Records. Beck took his act on the road with the 1995 Lollapalooza tour. Still, some critics panned him as a one-hit wonder. Audiences' (especially at Lollapalooza) familiarity with Loser only, and their general disinterest in his other work only reinforced his image as a one-hit wonder.  It's been said said that Beck released Stereopathetic Soulmanure and One Foot in the Grave to shake the Gen X-ers that associated themselves with him and made ""Loser"" their slacker anthem.    The one-hit wonder label was put to rest with the release of 1996's Odelay, a collaborative effort with The Dust Brothers, producers of Paul's Boutique. The lead single, ""Where It's At"", received heavy airplay and its video was in constant rotation on MTV. Within the year, Odelay had received perfect reviews in Rolling Stone and Spin magazines, having been listed on countless ""Best of"" lists (it topped the Pazz & Jop Critics Poll for 'Album of the Year'), receiving double-platinum status, and earning an impressive number of industry awards, including two Grammys.  Odelay was followed in 1998 by Mutations. Produced by Nigel Godrich of Radiohead fame, it was intended as a stopgap measure before the next album proper. Recorded over two weeks, during which Beck recorded one song a day, the sessions produced 14 songs. Mutations was a departure from the electronic density of Odelay, and was filled with folk and blues influences. Songs on the album consisted of older tracks, some even dating back as far as 1994.  In 1999, Geffen released the much-anticipated Midnite Vultures, an orgy of sexual and culinary innuendo supported by a world tour. For Beck, it was a return to the high-energy performances that had been his trademark as far back as Lollapalooza.   After Midnite Vultures came Sea Change in 2002, another airy and emotional album with producer Nigel Godrich, which became Beck's first U.S. Top 10 album, reaching # 8.  Sea Change was conceptualized as an album with one unifying theme--the stages following the end of a relationship. The album also featured string arrangements by Beck's father and a sonically dense mix reminiscient of Mutations. The Sea Change tour featured The Flaming Lips as Beck's opening and backing band.  In September 2003, Beck returned to the studio to work on his sixth major-label album. Guero was produced by the Dust Brothers and Tony Hoffer and features a collaboration with Jack White of The White Stripes; it marked a return to Odelay-era sound. The album was released in March of 2005 and despite critical acclaim, the album received a more lackluster response from Beck's indie-oriented fanbase.  Beck married Marissa Ribisi in April 2004, shortly before the birth of their son, Cosimo Henri Hansen.  2004 also saw the release of ""10 Years of Mellow Gold,"" a short documentary about Beck's first album.  Beck's next album, The Information was released on October 3, 2006. It is a largely electronic and ambient, filled with blips and beeps. It was produced by Nigel Godrich, who worked on ""Sea Change"" and a longtime Radiohead and Thom Yorke producer. The first single was Nausea, an acoustic rock hip hop song. The next single was Cellphone's Dead, and the third single was Think I'm In Love.  His next single, Timebomb, was released on iTunes on August 21, 2007, and the limited edition vinyl 12"" was released on November 2, 2007, with an instrumental version of the song on the B-side. In December, 2007, it was announced that Timebomb had been nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance.   Modern Guilt was the eighth studio album by Beck. It was released on July 8, 2008. The album fulfilled Beck's recording contract with Interscope Records. Outside of North America, the record was released by XL Recordings. Its three singles were Chemtrails, Gamma Ray, and Youthless.  Modern Guilt features two contributions by Cat Power and was produced by Beck and Danger Mouse.  The album entered both the Billboard 200 and the Canadian Albums Chart at number four, and gave Beck his first ever Top 10 placing on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at number nine. The album has also been Beck's best charting album in Australia, reaching 13. It sold 84,000 copies in its first week. Although successful, this does not match the first week sales of The Information, which were 99,000. In December 2008, Modern Guilt was nominated for Best Alternative Album at the 51st Grammy Awards.  Song Reader, a project Beck released in December 2012, is 20 songs presented only as sheet music, in the hopes that enterprising musicians will record their own versions. The idea of Song Reader came about nearly fifteen years prior, shortly after the release of Odelay. When sent a book of transcribed sheet music for that album, Beck decided to play through it and grew interested in the world before recorded sound. He aimed to keep the arrangements as open as possible, to re-create the simplicity of the standards, and became preoccupied with creating only pieces that could fit within the Great American Songbook. In 2013 Beck began playing special Song Reader concerts with a variety of guests and announced he was working on a record of Song Reader material with other musicians as well as possibly a compilation of fan versions.  In the summer of 2013, Beck was reported to be working on two new studio albums: one a more self-contained acoustic disc in the vein of One Foot In The Grave and another described as a ""proper follow-up"" to Modern Guilt. Beck expects to release both albums independently. He released two standalone singles over the course of the summer: the electro ballad Defriended and the chorus-heavy I Won't Be Long. A third single, Gimme, appeared on September 17.  In October 2013, it was announced that Beck signed to Capitol Records. Beck released his twelfth studio album entitled Morning Phase on 21 February 2014. For the recording of Morning Phase, Beck reunited with many of the same musicians with whom he had worked on the critically acclaimed 2002 album Sea Change. On January 20, 2014, the album's first single Blue Moon was released. Beck released the second single, Waking Light, on February 4, 2014   2) BECK can refer to a fictional rock band from the Japanese Anime series BECK: Mongolian Chop Squad. The fictional BECK's songs feature in the BECK Original Sound Track. BECK's style and members are highly influenced by various different artists. From vocals in the style of Zack De La Rocha from Rage Against the Machine, guitar influenced by Tom Morello of the same band, the band is highly influenced by rap-rock.  As the series develops, other influence appear, including guitar in the style of Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page, and Red Hot Chili Peppers John Frusciante. During the series, the band covers a famous The Beatles song, 'I've got a Feeling'. The name BECK could have possibly been influenced by the first artist Beck, mentioned above.

He rose to fame in the early 1990s with his lo-fi, sonically experimental style, and he became well known for creating musical collages of a wide range of styles. His later recordings encompass folk, funk, soul, hip hop, alternative rock, country, and psychedelia. He has released 12 studio albums, as well as several non-album singles and a book of sheet music. 
Born in Los Angeles in 1970, Beck discovered hip hop and folk music in his teens and began to perform locally at coffeehouses and clubs. He moved to New York City in 1989 and became involved in the city's small but intense anti-folk movement. After returning to his hometown in the early 1990s, he cut his breakthrough single ""Loser"", which became a worldwide hit in 1994. His 1996 album Odelay produced hit singles, topped critic polls and won several awards. He released the stripped-down Mutations in 1998, and the funk-infused Midnite Vultures in 1999. The downcast, acoustic Sea Change (2002) showcased a more serious Beck, and 2005's Guero returned to sample-based production. The Information (2006) was inspired by electro-funk and hip hop, and Modern Guilt (2008), likewise, by 1960s music. In February 2014, Beck released the album Morning Phase. It won Album of the Year at the 57th Grammy Awards on February 8, 2015. 
With a pop art collage of musical styles, oblique and ironic lyrics, and postmodern arrangements incorporating samples, drum machines, live instrumentation and sound effects, Beck has been hailed by critics and the public throughout his musical career as being among the most creative and idiosyncratic musicians of 1990s and 2000s alternative rock. Two of Beck's most popular and acclaimed recordings are Odelay and Sea Change, both of which were ranked on Rolling Stone‍‍ '​‍s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The four-time platinum artist has collaborated with several artists and has made several contributions to soundtracks. Beck is married to actress Marissa Ribisi, and is a Scientologist. 

Early life:
Beck was born in Los Angeles, to David Campbell, a Canadian-born musician, and Bibbe Hansen, a visual artist and former Warhol superstar. Bibbe's maternal grandmother was Jewish, while Bibbe's father, Al Hansen, was partly of Norwegian descent. Beck has said that he was ""raised celebrating Jewish holidays"", and that he considers himself Jewish. Beck's mother grew up amid New York's Andy Warhol Factory art scene of the 1960s, but moved to California at age 17, where she met Campbell. His father is a Canadian-born arranger, composer and conductor who worked on hundreds of albums and numerous films. 
Beck began life in a rooming house near downtown Los Angeles. As a child, he lived in a declining neighborhood just off Hollywood Boulevard. ""By the time we left there, they were ripping out miles of houses en masse and building low-rent, giant apartment blocks,"" he later recalled. The lower-class family struggled financially, moving to Hoover and Ninth Street, a neighborhood populated primarily by Koreans and Salvadorian refugees. He was sent for a time to live with his paternal grandparents in Kansas, with Beck later remarking that ""I think they were kind of concerned"" about his ""weird"" home life. Since his paternal grandfather was a Presbyterian minister, Beck grew up influenced by church music and hymns. Beck also spent time in Europe with his maternal grandfather, Al Hansen, a visual collage artist and a pioneer in the avant-garde Fluxus movement. 
After his parents separated when he was ten, Beck stayed with his mother and brother in Los Angeles, where he was influenced by the city's diverse musical offerings--everything from hip hop to Latin music and his mother's art scene--all of which would later reappear in his recorded and published work. Beck obtained his first guitar at 16 and became a street musician, often playing Lead Belly covers at Lafayette Park. During his teens, Beck discovered the music of Sonic Youth, Pussy Galore and X, but remained uninterested in most music outside folk until many years into his career. The first contemporary music that made a direct connection with Beck was hip hop, which he first heard on Grandmaster Flash records in the early 1980s. Growing up in a predominantly Latin district, he found himself the only white child at his school, and he quickly learned to breakdance. When he was 17, Beck grew fascinated after hearing a Mississippi John Hurt record at a friend's house, and spent hours in his room trying to emulate the finger picking of the country-blues guitarist. Shortly thereafter, Beck explored blues and folk music further, discovering Woody Guthrie and Blind Willie Johnson. 
Feeling like ""a total outcast"", Beck dropped out of school after junior high. He later said that although he felt school was important, he felt unsafe there. When he applied to the new performing arts high school downtown, he was rejected. His brother, Channing, took him to post-Beat jazz places in Echo Park and Silver Lake. He hung out at the Los Angeles City College, perusing records, books and old sheet music in its library. He used a fake I.D. to sit in on classes there, and he also befriended a literature instructor and his poet wife. He soon began a stream of menial jobs, including loading trucks and operating a leaf blower. 

Career:

Early performing and first releases (1985-93):
Beck began as a folk musician, switching between country blues, Delta blues and more traditional rural folk music in his teens. He began performing on city buses, often covering Mississippi John Hurt alongside original, sometimes improvisational compositions. ""I'd get on the bus and start playing Mississippi John Hurt with totally improvised lyrics. Some drunk would start yelling at me, calling me Axl Rose. So I'd start singing about Axl Rose and the levee and bus passes and strychnine, mixing the whole thing up,"" he later recalled. He was also in a band called Youthless that hosted Dadaist-inspired freeform events at city coffee shops. ""We had Radio Shack mics and this homemade speaker and we'd draft people in the audience to recite comic books or do a beatbox thing, or we'd tie the whole audience up in masking tape,"" Beck recalled. 
In 1989, Beck caught a bus to New York City with little more than eight dollars and a guitar. He spent the summer attempting to find a job and a place to live with little success. Beck eventually began to frequent Manhattan's Lower East Side and stumbled upon the tail end of the East Village's anti-folk scene's first wave. Beck became involved in a loose posse of acoustic musicians--including Cindy Lee Berryhill, Kirk Kelly, Paleface, and Lach, headed by Roger Manning--whose raggedness and eccentricity placed them well outside the acoustic mainstream. ""The whole mission was to destroy all the clichés and make up some new ones,"" said Beck of his New York years. ""Everybody knew each other. You could go up onstage and say anything, and you wouldn't feel weird or feel any pressure."" Inspired by that freedom and by the local spoken-word performers, Beck began to write free-associative, surrealistic songs about pizza, MTV, and working at McDonald's, turning mundane thoughts into songs. Beck was roommates with Paleface, sleeping on his couch and attending open mic nights together. Daunted by the prospect of another homeless New York winter, Beck returned to his home of Los Angeles in early 1991. ""I was tired of being cold, tired of getting beat up,"" he later remarked. ""It was hard to be in New York with no money, no place.... I kinda used up all the friends I had. Everyone on the scene got sick of me."" 
Back in Los Angeles, Beck began to work at a video store in Silver Lake ""doing things like alphabetizing the pornography section"". He began performing in arthouse clubs and coffeehouses such as Al's Bar and Raji's. In order to keep indifferent audiences engaged in his music, Beck would play in a spontaneous, joking manner. ""I'd be banging away on a Son House tune and the whole audience would be talking. So maybe out of desperation or boredom, or the audience's boredom, I'd make up these ridiculous songs just to see if people were listening,"" he later remarked. Virtually an unknown to the public and an enigma to those who met him, Beck would hop onstage between acts in local clubs and play ""strange folk songs"", accompanied by ""what could best be described as performance art"" while sometimes wearing a Star Wars stormtrooper mask. Beck met someone who offered to help record demos in his living room, and he began to pass cassette tapes around. 
Eventually, Beck gained key boosters in Margaret Mittleman, the West Coast's director of talent acquisitions for BMG Music Publishing, and the partners behind independent record label Bong Load Custom Records: Tom Rothrock, Rob Schnapf and Brad Lambert. Schnapf saw Beck perform at Jabberjaw and felt he would suit their small venture. Beck expressed a loose interest in hip hop, and Rothrock introduced him to Carl Stephenson, a record producer for Rap-A-Lot Records. In 1992, Beck visited Stephenson's home to collaborate. The result--the slide-sampling hip hop track ""Loser""--was a one-off experiment that Beck set aside, going back to his folk songs, making his home tapes, such as Golden Feelings, and releasing several independent singles. 

Mellow Gold, and independent albums (1993-94):
By 1993, Beck was living in a rat-infested shed near a Los Angeles alleyway with little money. Bong Load issued ""Loser"" as a single in March 1993 on 12"" vinyl with only 500 copies pressed. Beck felt that ""Loser"" was mediocre, and only agreed to its release at Rothrock's insistence. ""Loser"" unexpectedly received radio airplay, starting in Los Angeles, where college radio station KXLU was the first to play it, and later on Santa Monica College radio station KCRW, where radio host Chris Douridas played the song on Morning Becomes Eclectic, the station's flagship music program. ""I called the record label that day and asked to have Beck play live on the air,"" Douridas said. ""He came in that Friday, rapped to a tape of 'Loser' and did his song 'MTV Makes Me Want to Smoke Crack.'"" That night, Beck performed at the Los Angeles club Cafe Troy to a packed audience and talent scouts from major labels. The song then spread to Seattle through KNDD, and KROQ-FM began playing the song on an almost hourly basis. As Bong Load struggled to press more copies of ""Loser"", Beck was beset with offers to sign with major labels. During the fierce bidding war in November, Beck spent several days in Olympia, Washington, recording material with Calvin Johnson of Beat Happening, which would later see release the following year on Johnson's K Records as One Foot in the Grave. 
A fierce bidding war ensued, with Geffen Records A&R director Mark Kates signing Beck in December 1993 despite intense competition from Warner Bros. and Capitol. Beck's non-exclusive contract with Geffen allowed him an unusual amount of creative freedom, with Beck remaining free to release material through such small, independent labels as Flipside, which issued the sprawling, 25-track collection of pre-""Loser"" recordings titled Stereopathetic Soulmanure on February 22 the following year. By the time Beck released his first album for Geffen, the low-budget, genre-blending Mellow Gold on March 1, ""Loser"" was already in the top 40 and its video in MTV's Buzz Bin. ""Loser"" quickly ascended the charts in the U.S., reaching a peak of number ten on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and topping the Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song also charted in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and throughout Europe. Beck's newfound position of attention led to his characterization as the ""King of Slackers"", as the media dubbed him the center of the new so-called ""slacker"" movement. Critics, feeling it the essential follow-up to Radiohead's ""Creep"", found vacantness in the lyrics of ""Loser"" strongly associated with Generation X, although Beck himself strongly contested his position as the face of the ""slacker"" generation: ""Slacker my ass. I mean, I never had any slack. I was working a $4-an-hour job trying to stay alive. That slacker stuff is for people who have the time to be depressed about everything."" 

Backlash and Odelay (1994-97):
Feeling as though he were ""constantly trying to prove myself"", Beck suffered a backlash, with skeptics denouncing him as a self-indulgent fake and the latest marketing opportunity. In the summer of 1994, Beck was struggling and many of his fellow musicians thought he had lost his way. Combined with the song's wildly popular music video and the world tour, Beck reacted believing the attention could not last, resulting in a status as a ""one-hit wonder"". At other concerts, crowds were treated to twenty minutes of reggae or Miles Davis or jazz-punk iterations of ""Loser"". At one-day festivals in California, he surrounded himself with an artnoise combo. The drummer set fire to his cymbals; the lead guitarist ""played"" his char with the strings faced towards his body; and Beck changed the words to ""Loser"" so that nobody could sing along. ""I can't tell you how many times I was looking at faces that were looking back at me with complete bewilderment--or just pointing and shaking their heads and laughing--while performing during that period,"" he later recalled. Despite this, Beck gained the respect of his peers, such as Tom Petty and Johnny Cash, and created an entire wave of bands determined to recapture the Mellow Gold sound. Feeling his previous releases were just collections of demos recorded over the course of several years, Beck desired to enter the studio and record an album in a continuous linear fashion, which became Odelay. 
Beck blends country, blues, rap, jazz and rock on Odelay, the result of a year and half of feverish ""cutting, pasting, layering, dubbing, and, of course, sampling"". Each day, the musicians started from scratch, often working on songs for 16 hours straight.Odelay's conception lies in an unfinished studio album Beck first embarked on following the success of ""Loser"", chronicling the difficult time he experienced: ""There was a cycle of everyone dying around me,"" he recalled later. He was constantly recording, and eventually put together an album of somber, orchestrated folk tunes; one that, perhaps, ""could have been a commercial blockbuster along with similarly themed work by Smashing Pumpkins, Nine Inch Nails and Nirvana"". Instead, Beck plucked one song from it--the Odelay album closer ""Ramshackle""--and shelved the rest. Beck was introduced to the Dust Brothers, producers of the Beastie Boys' album Paul's Boutique, whose cut-and-paste, sample-heavy production suited Beck's vision of a more fun, accessible album. After a record executive explained that Odelay would be a ""huge mistake"", he spent many months thinking ""that I'd blown it forever"". 
Odelay was released on June 18, 1996, to commercial success and critical acclaim. The record produced several hit singles, including ""Where It's At"", ""Devils Haircut"", and ""The New Pollution"", and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1997, winning a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album as well as a Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance for ""Where It's At"". During one busy week in January 1997, he landed his Grammy nominations, appeared on Saturday Night Live and Howard Stern, and did a last-minute trot on The Rosie O'Donnell Show. The combined buzz gave Odelay a second wind, leading to an expanded fan base and additional exposure. Beck enjoyed but, like several executives at Geffen, was bewildered by the success of Odelay. He would often get recognized in public, which made him feel strange. ""It's just weird. It doesn't feel right. It doesn't feel natural to me. I don't think I was made for that. I was never good at that,"" he later told Pitchfork.Odelay sold two million copies and put ""one-hit wonder"" criticisms to rest. During this time, he contributed ""Deadweight"" to the soundtrack of the film A Life Less Ordinary (1997). 

Mutations and Midnite Vultures (1998-2001):
Having not been in a proper studio since ""Deadweight"", Beck felt anxious to ""go in and just do some stuff real quick"", and compiled several songs he had had for years. Beck and his bandmates hammered out fourteen songs in fourteen days, although just twelve made it onto the album, 1998's Mutations. Beck decided on Nigel Godrich, producer for Radiohead's OK Computer the previous year, to be behind the boards for the project. Godrich was leaving the United States for England in a short time, which led to the album's quick production schedule--""No looking back, no doctoring anything"". The whole point of the record was to capture the performance of the musicians live, an uncharacteristic far-cry from the cut-and-paste aesthetic of Odelay. Though the album was originally slated for release by Bong Load Records, Geffen intervened and issued the record against Beck's wishes. The artist then sought to void his contracts with both record labels, and in turn the labels sued him for breach of contract. The litigation went on for years and it remains unclear to this day if it has ever been completely resolved. Beck was later awarded Best Alternative Music Performance for Mutations at the 42nd Grammy Awards. 
Midnite Vultures, Beck's next studio effort, was originally recorded as a double album, and more than 25 nearly completed songs were left behind. In the studio, Beck and producers studied contemporary hip hop and R&B, specifically R. Kelly, in order to embrace and incorporate those influences in the way Al Green and Stax records had done in previous decades. In July 1998, a core group began to assemble at Beck's Pasadena home: bassist Justin Meldal-Johnsen, keyboardist Roger Joseph Manning Jr., and producer-engineers Mickey Petralia and Tony Hoffer. Dozens of session players passed through, including Beck's father, David Campbell, who played viola and arranged some of the strings. The musicians held communal meals and mountain-bike rides on dusty trails nearby, but remained focused on Beck's instructions: to make an up-tempo album that would be fun to play on tour night after night. ""I had so many things going on"", said Beck of the recording process. ""I had a couple of rooms of computers hooked up, I was doing B sides for Japan, I was programming beats in one room and someone would be cooking dinner in the other room."" In November 1999, Geffen released the much-anticipated Midnite Vultures, which attracted confusion: ""fans and critics misguidedly worried whether it was serious or a goof,"" and as a result, The New York Times wrote that the album ""never won the audience it deserved"". The record was supported by an extensive world tour. For Beck, it was a return to the high-energy performances that had been his trademark as far back as Lollapalooza. The live stage set included a red bed that descended from the ceiling for the song ""Debra"", and the touring band was complemented by a brass section.Midnite Vultures was nominated for Best Album at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards. 

Sea Change (2002-03):
In 2000, Beck and his fiancée, stylist Leigh Limon, ended their nine-year relationship. Beck lapsed into a period of melancholy and introspection, during which he wrote the bleak, acoustic-based tracks later found on Sea Change. Beck sat on the songs, not wanting to talk about his personal life; he later said that he wanted to focus on music and ""not really strew my baggage across the public lobby"". Eventually, however, he decided the songs spoke to a common experience (a relationship breakup), and that it would not seem self-indulgent to record them. In 2001, Beck drifted back to the songs and called producer Nigel Godrich. 
Retailers initially predicted that the album would not receive much radio support, but they also believed that Beck's maverick reputation and critical acclaim, in addition to the possibility of multiple Grammy nominations, might offset Sea Change's uncommercial sound.Sea Change, issued by Geffen in September 2002, was regardless a commercial hit and critical darling, with Rolling Stone revering it as ""the best album Beck has ever made, ... an impeccable album of truth and light from the end of love. This is his Blood on the Tracks."" The album was later listed by the magazine as one of the best records of the decade and of all-time, and it also placed second on the year's Pazz & Jop Critics Poll. Sea Change yielded a low-key, theater-based acoustic tour, as well as a larger tour with The Flaming Lips as Beck's opening and backing band. Beck was playful and energetic, sometimes throwing in covers of The Rolling Stones, Big Star, The Zombies and The Velvet Underground. 
Following the release of Sea Change, Beck felt newer compositions were sketches for something more evolved in the same direction, and wrote nearly 35 more songs in the coming months, keeping demos of them on tapes in a suitcase. During his solo tour, the tapes were left backstage during a stop in Washington, D.C., and Beck was never able to recover them. It was disheartening to the musician, who felt the two years of songwriting represented something more technically complex. As a result, Beck took a break and wrote no original compositions in 2003. Feeling as though it might take him a while to ""get back to that songwriting territory"", he entered the studio with Dust Brothers to complete a project that dated back to Odelay. Nearly half of the songs had existed since the 1990s. 

Guero and The Information (2004-07):
Guero, Beck's eighth studio album, was recorded over the span of nine months during which several significant events occurred in his life: his girlfriend, Marissa Ribisi, became pregnant; they were married; their son, Cosimo, was born; and they moved out of Silver Lake. The collaboration with the Dust Brothers, his second, was notable for their use of high-tech measures to achieve a low-fi sound. For example, after recording a ""sonically perfect"" version of a song at one of the nicest recording studios in Hollywood, the Dust Brothers processed it in an Echoplex to create a gritty, reverb-heavy sound: ""We did this high-tech recording and ran it through a transistor radio. It sounded too good, that was the problem."" Initially due to be released in October 2004, Guero faced delays and did not come out till March 2005, though unmastered copies of the tracks surfaced online in January. 

Guero debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, selling 162,000 copies, an all-time sales high. Lead single ""E-Pro"" peaked at number one at Modern Rock radio, making it his first chart-topper since ""Loser"". Beck, inspired by the Nintendocore remix scene and feeling a connection with its lo-fi, home-recording method, collaborated with artists 8-Bit and Paza on Hell Yes, an EP issued in February 2005. In December 2005, Geffen also issued Guerolito, a fully reworked version of Guero featuring remixes by the Beastie Boys' Ad-Rock, the Dust Brothers' John King and Scottish electronic duo Boards of Canada.Guerolito combines remixes previously heard as B-sides and new versions of album tracks to make a track-by-track reconfiguration of the album. 

The Information, Beck's ninth studio album, began production around the same time as Guero, in 2003. Working with producer Nigel Godrich, Beck built a studio in his garden, where they wrote many of the tracks. ""The idea was to get people in a room together recording live, hitting bad notes and screaming,"" said Beck, adding that the album is best described as ""introspective hip hop"". Beck described the recording process as ""painful"", noting that he edited down songs constantly and he perhaps recorded the album three times. For the release, Beck was allowed for the first time to fulfill a long-running wish for an unconventional rollout: he made low-budget videos to accompany each song, packaged the CD with sheets of stickers so buyers could customize the cover, and leaked tracks and videos on his website months ahead of the album's release. Digital download releases automatically downloaded the song's additional video for each single sale, and physical copies came bundled with an additional DVD featuring fifteen videos. 

Modern Guilt, Song Reader and independent production work (2008-12):
In 2007, Beck released the single ""Timebomb"", which was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance. For his next studio effort, his tenth, Beck tapped Danger Mouse to produce, and the two first met in December 2007 to record. The duo knocked out two tracks in two days, but the notion that the album would be finished in a timely fashion soon evaporated. Beck had known Danger Mouse casually before, as many of his former musicians ended up working with Danger Mouse's side project, Gnarls Barkley. Still, the musicians were surprised at how well they got along. Following the grueling recording schedule, Beck was exhausted, calling it ""the most intense work I've ever done on anything"", relating that he ""did at least 10 weeks with no days off, until four or five in the morning every night."" Beck's original vision was a short 10-track burst with two-minute songs, but the songs gradually grew as he fit 'two years of songwriting into two and a half months."" 
Modern Guilt (2008), ""full of off-kilter rhythms and left-field breakdowns, with an overall 1960s vibe"", was the final release in his contract with Geffen Records. Beck, then 38, had held the contract since his early 20s. Released from his label contract and going independent, Beck began working more heavily on his own seven-year-old label, which went through a variety of names. His focus on smaller, more quixotic projects, Beck moonlighted as a producer, working with artists such as Charlotte Gainsbourg, Thurston Moore and Stephen Malkmus. He worked for five or six days a week at the small studio on his property in Malibu, and founded Record Club, a project whereby an entire classic album--by The Velvet Underground, Leonard Cohen, INXS, Yanni--would be covered by another singer in the span of a single day. Beck provided four songs for the film Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010), each attributed to the title character's fictional band, Sex Bob-Omb. Beck also collaborated with Philip Glass,Jack White,Tobacco of Black Moth Super Rainbow, Jamie Lidell,Seu Jorge,Childish Gambino, and The Lonely Island. 
Song Reader, a project Beck released in December 2012, is 20 songs presented only as sheet music, in the hopes that enterprising musicians will record their own versions. The idea of Song Reader came about nearly fifteen years prior, shortly after the release of Odelay. When sent a book of transcribed sheet music for that album, Beck decided to play through it and grew interested in the world before recorded sound. He aimed to keep the arrangements as open as possible, to re-create the simplicity of the standards, and became preoccupied with creating only pieces that could fit within the Great American Songbook. In 2013 Beck began playing special Song Reader concerts with a variety of guests and announced he was working on a record of Song Reader material with other musicians as well as possibly a compilation of fan versions. 

Morning Phase and thirteenth studio album (2013-present):

In the summer of 2013, Beck was reported to be working on two new studio albums: one a more self-contained acoustic disc in the vein of One Foot in the Grave and another described as a ""proper follow-up"" to Modern Guilt. Beck expected to release both albums independently. He released two standalone singles over the course of the summer: the electro ballad ""Defriended"" and the chorus-heavy ""I Won't Be Long"". A third single, ""Gimme"", appeared on September 17. 
In October 2013, it was announced that Beck signed to Capitol Records. Beck released his twelfth studio album, Morning Phase, on February 21, 2014. For the recording of Morning Phase, Beck reunited with many of the same musicians with whom he had worked on the critically acclaimed 2002 album Sea Change. On January 20, 2014, the album's first single ""Blue Moon"" was released. Beck released the second single, ""Waking Light"", on February 4, 2014. 
In January 2015, it was announced that Beck will be headlining the Boston Calling Music Festival in May 2015. 
On February 8, 2015, at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards, Morning Phase won three Grammys: Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical; Best Rock Album; and Album of the Year. 
On June 15, 2015, Beck released the first single titled ""Dreams"" off his upcoming thirteenth studio album. The song was reportedly made for the purpose of having something lively to play while on tour. 

Collaborations and contributions:
In 1999, Beck contributed to a tribute album for Bruce Haack and Esther Nelson and their label Dimension 5 Records. The album, Dimension Mix, released in 2005, was a benefit for Cure Autism Now that was produced by Ross Harris, an early collaborator who designed the artwork for ""Mellow Gold"". 
On June 18, 2009, Beck announced that he was starting an experiment called Record Club, in which he and other musicians would record cover versions of entire albums in one day. The first album covered by Beck's Record Club was The Velvet Underground & Nico. Starting on June 18, the club began posting covers of songs from the album on Thursday evenings, each with its own video. On September 4, 2009, Beck announced the second Record Club album, Songs of Leonard Cohen. Contributors included MGMT, Devendra Banhart, Andrew Stockdale of Wolfmother and Binki Shapiro of Little Joy. In the third Record Club venture, Wilco, Feist, Jamie Lidell and James Gadson joined Beck to cover Skip Spence's Oar. The first song, ""Little Hands"", was posted on Beck's website on November 12, 2009. The Record Club has since covered albums by INXS and Yanni. 
On June 19, 2009, Beck announced Planned Obsolescence, a weekly DJ set put together by Beck or guest DJs. Soon after, on July 7, Beck announced that his website would be featuring ""extended informal conversations with musicians, artists, filmmakers, and other various persons"" in a section called Irrelevant Topics. Then, on July 12, he added a section called Videotheque, which he said would contain ""promotional videos from each album, as well as live clips, TV show appearances and other rarities"". 
Also in 2009, Beck collaborated with Charlotte Gainsbourg on her album IRM, which was released in January 2010. Beck wrote the music, co-wrote the lyrics, and produced and mixed the album. The lead single, ""Heaven Can Wait"", is a duet by Beck and Gainsbourg. 
In late February 2010, it was announced that electronic artist Tobacco of Black Moth Super Rainbow had collaborated with Beck on two songs, ""Fresh Hex"" and ""Grape Aerosmith"", on his upcoming album Maniac Meat. Tobacco revealed that in making the album, Beck sent the vocal parts to him, and that they had never actually met. 
In March 2010, Beck revealed that he had produced songs for the new Jamie Lidell album, Compass. 
In the summer of 2010, Beck contributed songs to both The Twilight Saga: Eclipse soundtrack, with ""Let's Get Lost"" (a duet with Bat for Lashes), and True Blood (HBO Original Series Soundtrack, Vol. 2), with ""Bad Blood"". He also contributed songs to the soundtrack of the movie Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, which was released in August 2010. Two of the songs that Beck specifically wrote for the film appeared in its theatrical trailer. 
In 2011, he collaborated with Seu Jorge on a track titled ""Tropicália (Mario C. 2011 Remix)"" for the Red Hot Organization's most recent charitable album Red Hot+Rio 2. The album is a follow-up to the 1996 Red Hot + Rio. Proceeds from the sales will be donated to raise awareness and money to fight AIDS/HIV and related health and social issues. He also contributed on the song ""Attracted to Us"" on Turtleneck & Chain, the second album from The Lonely Island. 
Also in 2011, Beck produced a solo album by Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth called Demolished Thoughts. An album he produced for Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks, Mirror Traffic, was released in August 2011. 
In October 2011, it was widely reported that Beck and producer Hector Castillo were collaborating with American composer Philip Glass to produce a remix album of the composer's works in honor of his 75th birthday. The album, Rework Philip Glass Remixed, was released on October 23, 2012, to critical acclaim, and featured Beck as both a curator and a performer. In particular, Pitchfork described Beck's 22-minute contribution to the album, ""NYC: 73-78"", as ""a fantasia ... the most startling and original piece of music with Beck's name on it in a while, and the first new work to bear his own spirit in even longer."" Reflecting on Beck's contribution to the album, Glass remarked that he was ""impressed by the novelty and freshness of a lot of the ideas"". Beyond his work as a performer, Beck acted as the album's curator, bringing together a diverse collection of artists--including Amon Tobin, Tyondai Braxton, Nosaj Thing, and Memory Tapes--whose work had also been influenced by Glass. In December 2012, an interactive iPhone app titled ""Rework_"" was released to complement the album. 
Beck has contributed three new songs--""Cities"", ""Touch the People"" and ""Spiral Staircase""--to the video game Sound Shapes for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation Vita. 
Beck collaborated on two songs for Childish Gambino's ""Royalty"" mixtape in 2012. 
In 2014, Beck collaborated with Sia for the song ""Moonquake Lake"", which is featured in the soundtrack for the 2014 Annie film. 

Musical style:
Beck's musical style has been considered alternative and indie. He has played many of the instruments in his music himself. Beck has also done some remixes for fellow artists, notably David Bowie and Björk. He has been known to synthesize several musical elements together in his music, including folk, psychedelia, electronic, country, Latin music, hip hop, funk, soul, blues, and many types of rock. He has also taken music from Los Angeles as a reference point in his songs. 
Beck has an irreverent style of sampling, often using such sources as obscure films to splice together cuts of people talking in the background of his music, or various other found sounds to create sound collages in the background of his music. 
Pitchfork Media applauded Midnite Vultures, saying, ""Beck wonderfully blends Prince, Talking Heads, Paul's Boutique, 'Shake Your Bon-Bon', and Mathlete on Midnite Vultures, his most consistent and playful album yet."" The review continued to comment on Beck, saying that his mix of goofy piety and ambiguous intent helped the album. A Beck song called ""Harry Partch"", a tribute to the composer and his ""Corporeal"" music, employs Partch's 43-tone scale. 

Art career:
During 1998, Beck's art collaborations with his grandfather Al Hansen were featured in an exhibition titled ""Beck & Al Hansen: Playing With Matches"", which showcased solo and collaborative collage, assemblage, drawing and poetry works. The show toured from the Santa Monica Museum of Art to galleries in New York City and Winnipeg, Manitoba, in Canada. A catalog of the show was published by Plug in Editions/Smart Art Press. 

Personal life:
Beck's nine-year relationship with designer Leigh Limon and their subsequent breakup is said to have inspired his 2002 album, Sea Change. He wrote most of the songs for the album in one week after the breakup. Beck married actress Marissa Ribisi, the twin sister of actor Giovanni Ribisi, in April 2004, shortly before the birth of their son, Cosimo Henri. Ribisi gave birth to their daughter, Tuesday, in 2007. Marissa and Giovanni Ribisi were delivered by Beck's mother, Bibbe Hansen. 
In November 2013 Beck revealed he had suffered a severe injury to his spine a few years earlier but is now doing better. 
Beck has self-identified both as Jewish and as a Scientologist. 

Scientology:
Beck has been involved in Scientology for most of his life; his wife, Marissa, is also a second-generation Scientologist. Beck publicly acknowledged his affiliation with Scientology for the first time in an interview published in The New York Times Magazine on March 6, 2005. Further confirmation came in an interview with the Irish Sunday Tribune's i Magazine on June 11, 2005, where he was quoted as saying, ""Yeah, I'm a Scientologist. My father has been a Scientologist for about 35 years, so I grew up in and around it."" When questioned by the interviewer about Scientology's core beliefs, he replied: 

What it actually is is just sort of, uh, you know, I think it's about philosophy and sort of, uh, all these kinds of, you know, ideals that are common to a lot of religions.... There's nothing fantastical ... just a real deep grassroots concerted effort for humanitarian causes. I don't know if you know the stuff they have. It's unbelievable the stuff they are doing. Education ... they have free centres all over the place for poor kids. They have the number one drug rehabilitation programme in the entire world (called Narconon). It has a 90-something percent success rate.... When you look at the actual facts and not what's conjured in people's minds that's all bullshit to me because I've actually seen stuff first hand. 

Appearances in media:
The 1986 punk rock musical film Population: 1, starring Tomata du Plenty of The Screamers, features a young Beck in a small nonspeaking role. Beck also appears in Southlander (2001), an American independent film by Steve Hanft and Ross Harris.

In his works he often told stories of marginalised and rebellious people, above all prostitutes, that were seen by De André as an answer to the bourgeois prissiness.  De André was born in Genoa, Liguria, Italy. His father was an anti-fascist, and during the war the De André family had to seek refuge in a country farm near Revignano d'Asti, Piedmont. The family returns in Genoa in 1945. Fabrizio studied law at the University of Genoa, but left before graduating.  His first instrument was the violin, and then he took up the guitar, playing in local jazz bands. In 1958 he recorded his first two songs: Nuvole barocche (""Baroque Clouds"") and E fu la notte (""Then Night Came""). In 1962 he married Puny Rignon, a Genoese woman nearly ten years his senior. The same year the couple had their first and only son, Cristiano De André, who would follow in his father's footsteps to become a musician and songwriter.  Over the years that followed, De André, inspired mainly by George Brassens' works, wrote a number of songs which made him known by a larger public; his song La Canzone Di Marinella (""Marinella's Song"") was recorded in 1968 by the famous Italian singer, Mina, and its author was acclaimed as the most important Italian cantautore, or singer-songwriter. The first De André EP, ""Volume I"", was released in 1967, and contain three af the most famous Fabrizio's songs: ""Via del Campo"" (literally ""Field Street"", a famous street of Genoa), ""Bocca di Rosa"" and ""Carlo Martello ritorna dalla battaglia di Poitiers"" (""Charles Martel on His Way Back From Poitiers""). The last one was written with Paolo Villaggio, a famous italian actor and also De André's friend.  His second album ""Tutti Morimmo A Stento""(""We all died hardly""), released in 1968, contains songs as ""Leggenda Di Natale"" based on the song ""Le Père Noël et la Petite Fille"", written by George Brassens, one of the most important influence for Fabrizio.  In 1968 was also released the thirt De André's album, Volume III, one of the most important album of this first period. In this album there are two songs inspired by Brassens' poetry, ""Il Gorilla"" and ""Nell'acqua della chiara fontana"". Other famous songs are ""La guerra di Piero""(""Piero's war"") ""La canzone di Marinella""(Marinella's Song""), previously released by Mina, and ""S'I' Fossi Foco""(If I were Fire""), from a poem by Cecco Angiolieri. In 1970 was released ""La Buona Novella""(""The Good Novella""), a religious concept album based on the vision of Christ's life told in Apocrypha. The album was very controversial for Jesus' vision by De André and especially for the song ""Il testamento di Tito"" (""Titus' Will""), in which one of the thieves crucified together with Jesus confutes violently the Ten Commandments. In 1971 was released one of the most famous and the most important De André's album, ""Non al denaro non all'amore né al Cielo"" based on Edgar Lee Masters ""Spoon River Anthology"", translated in italian by the famous italian poetess Fernanda Pivano, one of Fabrizio's best friend.      * ""La collina"" is based on ""The Hill""     * ""Un matto"" is based on ""Frank Drummer"", in which a man memorizes the Encyclopedia Britannica and is considered mad by the people of Spoon River.     * ""Un Giudice"" is based on Selah Lively, the story of a midget who studies law and becomes a judge to get a revenge against the people who made fun of him all his life.     * ""Un blasfemo"" is based on ""Wendell P. Bloyd"".     * ""Un malato di cuore"" is based on ""Francis Turner"", in which a man dies of a heart attack while giving his first kiss.     * ""Un medico"" is based on ""Dr. Siegfried Iseman"", the story of a doctor who wants to cure poor people without receiving any payment.     * ""Un chimico"" is based on ""Trainor, the Chemist"", in which a chemist, who doesn't understand the relationships between men and women but loves chemical elements, dies while executing an experiment.     * ""Un ottico"" is based on ""Dippold the Optician"", the story of an optician who wants to create special glasses which show strange images.     * ""Il suonatore Jones"" is based on ""Fiddler Jones"". Two years later was published another important album in Fabrizio's career, ""Storia di un Impiegato""(""The Story of a White-Collar""), in which De André analyses the Year Of Lead, (in Italy a period of political tensions, between 1968 and 80s characterized by bomb's massacre by neo-fascist and by kidnapping and  by murders by Brigate Rosse and other subversive organization).  This is another concept album, in which a man, inspired by French May, decided to rebel against the society knowing finally that his bomb and his rebellion was controlled by the State and directed to make the power stronger. This is one of the most complicated and hermetic album by De André. The year after was released a new album, ""Canzoni""(""Songs""), in which De André translated some famous songs by Bob Dylan(""Via della Povertà"", in english ""Desolation Row""), Leonard Cohen and Brassens, but also unreleased songs as ""La Città Vecchia""(""The Old City""), another highly famous song.  Is important to see how from this album and so on, De André was highly inspired by American Folk music.  De André divorced his wife Puny, and started a relationship with the folksinger Dori Ghezzi. In 1975 he began to perform in a series of memorable concerts (after his first performances of the early 1960s, he had always refused to appear in public, except for a couple of television broadcasts). In this year was released the new album, Volume VIII, written with Francesco de Gregori, a famous italian songwriter who also translated ""Desolation Row"" with Fabrizio. The most famous songs of this album are ""Amico Fragile""(""Fragile Friend"") and ""La Cattiva Strada""(""The Bad Way"").  In 1977, having moved to Sardinia, the couple had a daughter, and in the following year Fabrizio De André issued a new LP, Rimini. Most songs included in this album were written with a young Veronese singer-songwriter, Massimo Bubola. There's also ""Avventura a Durango"" a translation of ""Romance in Durango"" bu Bob Dylan.   1979 began with a series of famous live concerts from which a double LP is drawn; De André was accompanied by one of the most renowned Italian progressive rock bands, Premiata Forneria Marconi. At the end of August, De André and Ghezzi were kidnapped for ransom by a gang of Sardinian bandits, and held prisoner in the inaccessible Supramonte mountains. The couple was released four months later; no ransom was paid. When the bandits were apprehended by the police, and De André was called as witness before the Court, he refused to denounce his kidnappers and declared his own solidarity with them: «They were the real prisoners, not I», he said.  This dramatic episode, and the hard life of the Sardinian people, gave him inspiration for his following album, released in 1981. The album is anonymous, but, from the image of a native American appearing on the cover, the mass-media called it L'indiano (The Indian). The album contains one of his most famous songs, Fiume Sand Creek: it relates the massacre of defenceless native Americans of 29th November 1864 by U.S. Army troops.  In 1984 Fabrizio De André turned to his native Genoese dialect and wrote, together with former PFM member Mauro Pagani, one of his most celebrated albums, Crêuza de mä(""Path to the sea"", the term ""Crêuza"" actually indicates a narrow road bordered by low walls, typical of Genoa and its surroundings). The songs were a tribute to traditional music from every Mediterranean country.The album was awarded an unending series of prizes and was greeted as ""the best Italian album of the 1980s"". It was named by David Byrne as one of his favourite albums. As Pagani has repeatedly stated, De Andrè wrote the lyrics for the album, while the music was almost entirely Pagani's.  In 1989 Fabrizio De André married Dori Ghezzi; the following year a new album was issued, Le nuvole (""The clouds""), which included two more songs in the Genoese dialect, one in the Gallurese dialect of Northern Sardinia (Monti di Mola), and one in the Neapolitan dialect, the highly ironic Don Raffae'. A new series of live concerts followed, from which a double LP (1991 Concerti[) was drawn. In 1992 he started a new series of live concerts.  In 1997 De André started a new tour of theatre concerts and a new song collection, called  Mi innamoravo di tutto (""I fell in love with everything"") was issued. This tribute album included a version of La Canzone Di Marinella in duet with Mina. The Anime salve concert tour went on up to the late summer of 1998, when De André stopped at the first symptoms of a serious disease, which was later diagnosed as cancer.  He died in Milan on 11th January 1999. Two days later, he was buried in his native town, Genoa; the ceremony was attended by an immense crowd of about 20,000. Fabrizio De André rests in the monumental Staglieno cemetery, in the De André family chapel., Fabrizio De André (Genova, 18 febbraio 1940 - Milano, 11 ..., Fabrizio De André (Genova-Pegli, 18 febbraio 1940 – Milano, 11 ..., Fabrizio De André (February 18, 1940 - January 11, 1999) ..., With the death of Fabrizio De André from cancer on ..., With the death of Fabrizio De André from cancer on ..., With the death of Fabrizio De André from cancer on ..., Fabrizio Cristiano De André (18 February 1940 - 11 January 1999) was an Italian singer-songwriter. Known for his sympathies towards anarchism, left-libertarianism and pacifism, his songs often featured marginalized and rebellious people, gypsies, prostitutes and knaves, and attacked the Catholic Church hierarchy . Artistically active for almost 40 years and the author of thirteen studio albums, he is renowned for the quality of his lyrics and often considered a poet. He contributed to the promotion of the languages of Italy, most notably Ligurian and, to a lesser extent, Sardinian, Gallurese and Neapolitan. Following his early death several streets, places, parks, schools and public libraries were named after him. 

Biography:
De André was born in Genoa, and was welcomed into the world by Gino Marinuzzi's ""Country Waltz"" on the home gramophone. Twenty-five years later, he would set his ""Waltz for a Lover"" to Marinuzzi's waltz tune. 
When the Second World War broke out, the De André family had to seek refuge on a country farm near Revignano (a little town near Asti), in Piedmont. Fabrizio's father, who was an antifascista pursued by the police, joined the partisans. In 1945, at the end of the war, the family moved back to Genoa, where the father became an important member of Genoa's ruling class, as CEO, and later chairman of Eridania, a sugar factory. 
Fabrizio's first primary school was that of the Marcellian Sisters, and he later attended the Cesare Battisti public school and the Liceo Classico ""Cristoforo Colombo""; after his school leaving examination, he enrolled in the Law School of the University of Genoa, although he did not graduate, dropping out when he had only a few exams left. De André first played the violin, then the guitar, and he joined a number of local jazz bands, as jazz was his ""first love"". 

First recordings:
In 1960, De André recorded his first two songs, Nuvole barocche (""Baroque Clouds"") and E fu la notte (""And There Was Night""); in 1962, he married Puny Rignon, a Genoese woman nearly ten years older than him. That same year the couple had their first and only son, Cristiano, who would follow in his father's footsteps and become a musician and songwriter as well. 
In the following years De André wrote a number of songs which made him known to a larger public, soon becoming classic hits: La guerra di Piero (""Peter's War""), La ballata dell'eroe (""The Hero's Ballad""), Il testamento di Tito (""Titus's Will""), La Ballata del Michè (""Mike's Ballad""), Via del Campo (literally ""Field Street"", a famous street in Genoa), La canzone dell'amore perduto (""Song for Lost Love""), La città vecchia (""Old Downtown""), Carlo Martello ritorna dalla battaglia di Poitiers (""Charles Martel on His Way Back from Poitiers"", written together with actor Paolo Villaggio, one of De André's closest friends), and La canzone di Marinella (""Marinella's Song""). 

Volume 1:

De André's first LP, Volume 1, was issued shortly after (1967), followed by Tutti morimmo a stento (""We All Died Agonizingly"") and Volume 3; both LPs soon reached the top of the Italian hit-parade. The former contained a personal version of Eroina (""Heroin"") by the Genoese poet Riccardo Mannerini, entitled ""Cantico dei drogati"" (""Canticle of the Junkies""). 

La buona novella:
In 1970, De André wrote La buona novella (""Glad Tidings"" - a literal rendition of the etymology of gospel), a concept album based on Christ's life as told in the Apocrypha. The album was very controversial, especially the song Il testamento di Tito (""Titus's Will""), in which one of the thieves crucified with Jesus violently refutes the Ten Commandments. He had written a number of songs (like Preghiera in Gennaio, ""Prayer in January"", and Si chiamava Gesù, ""His Name Was Jesus"") in which he showed a Christian-like open-minded spirit and in the meantime invited the audience in his own delicate way to think about the manipulation of the church. 

Non al denaro non all'amore né al cielo:
In 1971, he wrote another celebrated concept album, Non al denaro non all'amore né al cielo (""Neither to money, nor to love, nor to Heaven""), based on Edgar Lee Masters's Spoon River Anthology; in an interview the LP was introduced to Fernanda Pivano, the first Italian translator of the ""Anthology"" and one of Cesare Pavese's most intimate friends. Fabrizio De André's name began to be associated with literature and poetry, and some of his songs found their way into school books. 

Storia di un impiegato and Canzoni:
In 1973, he wrote his most ""political"" album, Storia di un impiegato (""Story of an Employee"")., 
The following year, De André issued Canzoni (""Songs""), a collection of his translations from Georges Brassens, Leonard Cohen and Bob Dylan. The album also included a number of his old songs from the 1960s. 

Volume 8:
In 1975, De André (who in the meantime had divorced his wife Puny and begun a relationship with the folksinger Dori Ghezzi) wrote Volume 8 with another famous Italian singer-songwriter, Francesco De Gregori. With this album, he broke with ""tradition"" in order to find a new approach to poetry and music. The lyrics show how deep the influence of modern poetry is on De André's work. 1975 marked a real change in De André's life: he began to perform in a series of memorable concerts (after his first performances of the early 1960s, he had always refused to appear in public, except for a couple of TV broadcasts) and planned to move to Sardinia with his new love. For this purpose, he purchased the Agnata homestead near Tempio Pausania in the northern part of the island, where he could devote himself to farming and cattle breeding. 
In 1977, the couple had a daughter, Luisa Vittoria (nicknamed ""Luvi""). The following year De André issued a new LP, Rimini. Most songs included on this album were written together with Massimo Bubola, a young singer-songwriter from Verona. 

Concerts with PFM and kidnapping:
1979 was another milestone in De André's life. The year began with a series of distinguished live concerts from which a double LP was compiled; De André was accompanied by one of the most renowned Italian progressive rock bands, Premiata Forneria Marconi (PFM); the albums were released as In Concerto (1979), and In Concerto - Volume 2 (1980). At the end of August, however, De André and Ghezzi were kidnapped for ransom by a gang of bandits in Sardinia and held prisoner in the Alà dei Sardi mountains. The couple were released four months later with a ransom reportedly being paid. As De André stated in some interviews, he was helped by his father to find the money and had to start a tour shortly after the release of the ""Indiano"" album in order to repay him. When the bandits were apprehended by the police, De André was called as a witness before the Court. He showed compassion for some of his kidnappers, since he had been well treated by his ""guardians"" and declared his solidarity with them. ""They were the real prisoners, not I"", he said. He said he understood they were driven by need, but he did not show any compassion for the higher echelon of the group that organized his kidnapping, since they were already rich. 
This incident, and the hard life of the Sardinian people, gave him inspiration for his following album, released in 1981. The album is untitled but, due to the image of Native American on the cover, the mass-media called it ""The Indian"". In De André's poetical vision, the American Indians merge with the poor Sardinian shepherds as an allegory for the marginalization and subjugation of people who are ""different"". The song Hotel Supramonte, is dedicated to the kidnapping and to Dori Ghezzi, who was with him during those days. The album also contains one of his most famous songs, Fiume Sand Creek (""Sand Creek River""): in De André's unique, allusive way it tells the story of the massacre of defenseless Native Americans by US Army troops on 29 November 1864. 

Crêuza de mä:
In 1984, he turned to his native Genoese dialect; in collaboration with former PFM member Mauro Pagani he wrote one of his most celebrated albums, Crêuza de mä (""Path to the sea"", the term ""Crêuza"" actually means a narrow road bordered by low walls, typical of Genoa and Liguria in general). The songs are a tribute to the traditional music from the Mediterranean basin. The album was awarded several prizes and was hailed as ""the best Italian album of the 1980s"".David Byrne named it as one of his favourite albums, and Wim Wenders said that it was this album that introduced him to the music of De André, whom the director names as one of his favourite artists. As Pagani has repeatedly stated, De Andrè wrote the lyrics for the album, while the music was almost entirely Pagani's. 

1990s:
In 1989, De André married Ghezzi; the following year a new album was issued, Le nuvole (""The Clouds""), which included two more songs in the Genoese dialect, one in the Gallurese dialect of Northern Sardinia (""Monti di Mola"") and one in the Neapolitan dialect, the highly ironic ""Don Raffaè"". A new series of well received live concerts followed, from which a double LP, 1991 Concerti (""Concerts 1991""), was issued. 
In 1992, he started a new series of live concerts, performing in a number of theatres for the first time. 
De André's last original album, Anime salve (""Saved Souls""), was issued in 1996. Written in collaboration with Ivano Fossati, it represents a sort of ""spiritual will"", and includes songs such as ""Khorakhané"" (dedicated to the Muslim Roma people), ""Disamistade"" (a return to his beloved Sardinian themes, which has been translated into English and sung by The Walkabouts) and ""Smisurata preghiera"" (""An Infinite Prayer""), based on the Colombian writer and storyteller Álvaro Mutis's The Adventures and Misadventures of Maqroll. De André also sang a Spanish version of this song, Desmedida plegaria. 
In 1997, he undertook a new tour of theatre concerts and a new song collection called M'innamoravo di tutto was issued (""I Used to Fall in Love with Everything"", a quote from one of his older songs, Coda di Lupo - Wolf's Tail) . The Anime salve concert tour went on up to the late summer of 1998, when De André stopped after the first symptoms of a serious illness, which was later diagnosed as lung cancer. 
De André died in Milan on 11 January 1999, at 2:30 am. Two days later, he was buried in his native town, Genoa; the ceremony was attended by a crowd of about 20,000. He is buried in the Monumental Cemetery of Staglieno, in the De André family chapel. 

Fabrizio De André and faith:
In the concept album La buona novella (The Good News) (1970), De André gives us the ultimate expression of his religious vision, making a clear humanization of the divine. In a 1998 concert at the Teatro Brancaccio in Rome, De André made the following statements about the album: 

When I wrote La buona novella it was 1969. At the time we were in the very middle of the students' protests, and less attentive people, which are always the majority among us - comrades, friends, people of the same age as me - regarded that record as anachronistic. They told me: ""What's this? We go fighting inside universities and outside universities against abuses, and you instead tell us the story, which moreover we already know, of Jesus Christ's preachings?"" And they did not realize that the Good News was meant to be an allegory, it was an allegory that consisted in a comparison between the better and more sensible instances of the revolt of '68, and some instances, certainly higher from a spiritual point of view, but similar from an ethical-social point of view, raised by a gentleman, 1969 years before, against the abuses of power, against the abuses of authority, in the name of egalitarianism and universal brotherhood. That man was called Jesus of Nazareth. And I think he was, and remains, the greatest revolutionary of all time. When I wrote the album I didn't want to venture into roads or paths that would be difficult for me to travel on, such as metaphysics or even theology, first of all because I don't understand anything about those, secondly because I always thought that if God did not exist we should invent Him, which is exactly what Man has done ever since he set foot on Earth. 

Probably the characters in La buona novella lose a bit of sacralization, but I think, and I hope, particularly to the benefit of their better and greater humanization. 

The attitude taken by De André against the political use of religion and the Church hierarchy is often sarcastic and highly critical about their contradictory behaviour, such as, for example, in the songs Un blasfemo, Il testamento di Tito, La ballata del Miché and the last verses of Bocca di rosa. 

I feel myself religious, and my religion is to feel part of a whole, in a chain that includes all creation and so to respect all elements, including plants and minerals, because, in my opinion, the balance is exactly given from the well-being in our surroundings. My religion does not seek the principle, you want to call it creator, regulator or chaos makes no difference. But I think that everything around us has its own logic and this is a thought to which I turn when I'm in difficulty, perhaps giving the names I've learned as a child, maybe because I lack the imagination to find out other ones. 

After the kidnapping, the religious vision of De André had a new development; 

While I was abducted, it helped me to find faith in men, just where there wasn't faith in God. I have always said that God is a human invention, something utilitarian, a patch on the fragility ... But, however, with the kidnapping something has changed. I've not changed my mind, but it is certain that today swearing at least embarrasses me.]",0.433620466933,0.594963,[italian pop],0.601754,0.817800428601,0.458321977902,0.31490898826,0.622410443535,0.000330000129145,4.0,0.156469372731,0.7489198531,1.0,0.0530783817957,0.788692633426,4.0,0.390119372758,1

The band consisted of siblings Karin Dreijer Andersson (formerly of Honey is Cool, now Fever Ray) and Olof Dreijer - who also run their own record company, Rabid Records.  The group rarely made public appearances, most of their promotional photos featured the members wearing masks, and formerly refused to perform live concerts. However the group has showed themselves in public wearing masks formed as bird's beaks, similar to those used by medieval doctors.  The Knife won a Swedish Grammy award for best pop group of the year 2003, but they boycotted the ceremony by sending two representatives of another artist group dressed as gorillas with the number 50 written on their costumes, apparently as a protest against male dominance within the music industry. Their album Deep Cuts was also nominated for a Swedish Grammy as the best record of the year 2003, although that award went to The Cardigans. It was also in 2003 that the The Knife was featured as Artist of the Week at HitQuarters, which helped them gain greater attention in the worldwide music community.  The group became prominent in late 2005 when José González covered ""Heartbeats"" on his 2003 album, Veneer. The song was used by Sony in a commercial for Bravia television sets, and released as a single in early 2006. The group commented on this in a Dagens Nyheter article, claiming that Sony paid a large sum of money to use the song. In view of the group's left-wing views and non-commercial philosophy, they excused this transaction on the basis that the money was needed to establish their record company.  The Knife's song ""We Share Our Mothers' Health"" from their album Silent Shout was featured by the iTunes store as a free song of the week in late 2006. This song was also featured in the ABC series Ugly Betty, as well as an episode of CSI: NY.  In February 2005, the Knife performed their first ever live show at London's ICA, appearing with Rex the Dog and playing in front of a video created for the event by artist/film maker Andreas Nilsson. With this one live performance The Knife embarked on a major tour in 2006, and after selling out shows worldwide, a DVD of the tour was announced. The DVD was released in Sweden on November 8, 2006, and is titled Silent Shout: An Audio Visual Experience.  Silent Shout was named the best album of 2006 by Pitchfork Media. At the Swedish Grammy awards in January 2007, The Knife won in all six categories they were nominated in: Composer of the Year, Music DVD of the Year, Producer of the Year, Pop Group of the Year, Album of the Year and Artist of the Year. Again, they did not attend the award ceremony.  In 2009 the duo wrote the opera Tomorrow, in a Year, celebrating 150 years since Darwin's Origin of Species was published.   In April 2013 they released the album Shaking the Habitual.  In 2014 Karin Dreijer revealed in a interview that the Knife are calling it quits for good.

The group consisted of siblings Karin Dreijer Andersson and Olof Dreijer, who together also run their own record company, Rabid Records. The group gained a large international following in response to their 2003 album Deep Cuts. 
The duo's first tour took place in 2006, along with the release of their critically acclaimed album Silent Shout. They have won a number of Swedish Grammis, but refuse to attend awards ceremonies. They have appeared in public wearing Venetian masks. Andersson released a solo album under the name Fever Ray in 2009, while Olof Dreijer released several EPs as Oni Ayhun in late 2009 and early 2010. The Knife disbanded in November 2014 after playing the final dates of their Shaking the Habitual Tour. 

History:
Formed in Gothenburg in 1999, amidst the deterioration of Karin's former group Honey Is Cool, the group perhaps gained stronger international recognition when José González covered their song ""Heartbeats"" on his 2003 album, Veneer. The cover was used by Sony in a commercial for BRAVIA television sets, and released as a single in 2006. The group commented on this in a Dagens Nyheter article, claiming that Sony paid a large sum of money to use the song. Despite the group's anti-commercial views, they justified the transaction by citing their need for money to establish a record company. 
Having never before performed live, The Knife went on tour in 2006, and after selling out shows worldwide, a DVD of the tour was announced. The DVD was released in Sweden on 8 November 2006, and is titled Silent Shout: An Audio Visual Experience. 
On 4 August 2009, the band announced that, in collaboration with Mt. Sims and Planningtorock, they would be writing an opera for the Danish performance group Hotel Pro Forma. The opera, titled Tomorrow, In a Year, is based on Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species. In January 2010, the band announced that they would release a studio version on 1 March. 
In a September 2010 post on the official Fever Ray website, Karin stated that she and Olof ""have started playing together again"", hinting that new material may be on the way. On 18 April 2011, as part of a post on their website concerning discrimination against Romani people in Europe, The Knife announced that they were recording a new album to be released in 2012. In December 2012, it was confirmed that their next album would be titled Shaking the Habitual and would be released on 8 April 2013. The duo posted a teaser trailer for the album on their YouTube account with the message: ""Music can be so meaningless. We had to find lust. We asked our friends and lovers to help us."" The album was supported by tour dates in Europe in 2013. ""Full of Fire"" was released as the album's lead single on 28 January 2013, for which a short film was directed by Stockholm and Berlin-based filmmaker and visual artist Marit Östberg. 
After announcing their plans to play at Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April 2014, The Knife also announced plans to tour North America during that time period. On 21 August 2014, The Knife announced that the duo would disband following the final six dates of their Shaking the Habitual Show Tour from 31 October to 8 November 2014. In the duo's final interview, Karin told Dazed, ""We don't have any obligations to continue, it should only and always be for fun."" 

Relationship with the media:
The Knife rarely cooperate with the media or the mainstream music scene. Until 2005, they did not perform live concerts. The group rarely makes public appearances; most of their promotional photos feature the members wearing masks with birds' beaks, similar to the traditional Venetian Medico Della Peste (plague doctor) masks worn during Carnival. 
The Knife won the Swedish Grammis award for Pop Group of the Year in 2003, but they boycotted the ceremony by sending two representatives of the Guerrilla Girls, with the number 50 written on their costumes, as a protest against male dominance in the music industry. Their album Deep Cuts was also nominated for the best record of the year, although that award went to The Cardigans. At the Grammis awards in 2007, The Knife won in all six categories that they were nominated in: Composer of the Year, Music DVD of the Year, Producer of the Year, Pop Group of the Year, Album of the Year and Artist of the Year. Again, they did not attend the award ceremony. On another occasion, they did not come to collect the award but sent a manipulated video that muffled their voices and made them look very elderly. 
Silent Shout was named the best album of 2006 by Pitchfork Media. The song ""We Share Our Mothers' Health"" from the album was made available for free as the iTunes Store's Single of the Week in late 2006. This song was also featured in the ABC series Ugly Betty, as well as an episode of CSI: NY. In August 2007, ""Heartbeats"" was featured in an episode of the HBO series Entourage. The song was later used in an episode of the HBO series Girls. 
Their song ""Pass This On"" was used in the 2010 drama film Les amours imaginaires by Quebec director Xavier Dolan. The film premiered in the Un Certain Regard section of the 2010 Cannes Film Festival. ""Pass This On"" was also used in the 2011 drama Elles by Polish director Małgorzata Szumowska and in the 2013 thriller Magic Magic by Chilean director Sebastián Silva, which premiered at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival and opens with Canadian actor Michael Cera singing along to the song. The documentary film The Jeffrey Dahmer Files used the song ""Still Light"" during the closing credits. 

Influences:
In a 2006 interview with Pitchfork Media, The Knife cited David Lynch, Aki Kaurismäki, Korean cinema, Trailer Park Boys, Donnie Darko and Doom as inspirations for their work. In addition, Karin named Sonic Youth, Kate Bush, Le Tigre and Siouxsie and the Banshees, while Olof cited techno, grime and Southern hip hop. 

Members' solo projects:
In 2008, Karin announced that she would release a solo album under the name Fever Ray in March 2009. The eponymous album was digitally released in advance of this date. The single ""If I Had a Heart"" was featured in a 2011 episode of Breaking Bad and in the 2013 film Horns, is the opening theme of the Canadian-Irish historical drama television series Vikings, and is the opening of the movie Laurence Anyways by Quebec director Xavier Dolan, who also used her song ""Keep the Streets Empty For Me"" in his movie Les Amours Imaginaires.

Banhart was born in Houston, Texas and was raised by his mother in Venezuela, until he moved to California as a teenager. His first few records were released on the young god records label from New York City.  His most recent CD was released by Nonesuch. He is one of the most popular artists to come out of the ""new weird america"" movement, which includes performers such as Faun Fables, Viking Moses, Jack Rose, Jana Hunter, Arborea, The MV & EE Medicine Show, Currituck Co., Six Organs of Admittance, and The Royal We, among others. He also often joins the band known as Vetiver.  Banhart is considered to have an eclectic style, with many of his songs seemingly following a stream-of-consciousness vein, being hard to decipher and non-literal. His music tends to consist of fairly simple guitar melodies with minimal other instrumentation, and his lyrical themes are often surreal and naturalistic. His involvement in the Los Angeles artist community is reflected in Smokey Rolls Down Thunder Canyon, released in September 2007. He gained some underground notoriety in New York for performing several of his early shows with underwear on his head for the duration of the performance.  Banhart's most recent tour of the United States saw him perform with his full band, which is currently known as Power Mineral. Power Mineral included Andy Cabic (Vetiver), Greg Rogove (Priestbird), Noah Georgeson, Luckey Remington, Pete Newsom, Otto Hauser (Vetiver, Currituck Co., Espers, Nick Castro), Kevin Barker (Currituck Co.), and others. The band claims to rechristen itself when a name comes to them, and has previously been known as Fried Hummingbird, Vagina Burglars, Hairy Fairy Band, Las Putas Locas, Stoner Boner, Spiritual Boner, Bummer Hummer, Brain Taint, Love Fart, Bathhouse Of The Winds, and First Woman Millionaire among other names.  Banhart was discovered by Michael Gira of Swans, who released his Oh Me Oh My... The Way the Day Goes by the Sun Is Setting Dogs Are Dreaming... album on his own Young God Records label in 2002. In 2005, Banhart (along with Andy Cabic and Revolver USA) created the Gnomonsong record label. In 2006 he helped to curate an edition of the British All Tomorrow's Parties festival.  Banhart also was one of the younger musicians responsible for ""rediscovering"" the music of folksinger Vashti Bunyan.

Banhart was born in Houston, Texas and was raised by his mother in Venezuela, until he moved to California as a teenager. He began to study at the San Francisco Art Institute in 1998, but dropped out to perform music in Europe, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Banhart released his debut album in 2002, continuing to record his material on the Young God and XL labels, as well as other work on compilations and collaborations. 

Early life and career:
Banhart was born May 30, 1981 in Houston, Texas, to a Venezuelan mother and an American father, Robert Gary Banhart. His given name is a synonym for Indra, the king of Gods (Hindu), which was suggested by Prem Rawat, an Indian religious leader whom Banhart's parents followed. Banhart's middle name Obi was modeled after Obi-Wan Kenobi, a Star Wars character. Banhart's parents divorced two years after his birth and he moved with his mother to Caracas, Venezuela. His mother later remarried and Banhart's stepfather moved the family to Los Angeles, when Banhart was 14 years old. 
In 1998, Banhart began studying at the San Francisco Art Institute on a scholarship while living in The Castro, San Francisco's gay neighborhood. He began to busk instead of attending classes and played his first show in a church at a gay wedding, performing Elvis Presley's ""Love Me Tender"" and the classic hymn ""How Great Thou Art."" Banhart dropped out of art school in 2000 and left San Francisco after the dot-com bust worsened the city's economy. He moved to Paris over the summer and opened shows for indie rock bands such as Sonic Youth. Banhart returned to the United States in the fall of 2000 and played music in San Francisco and Los Angeles, until he was discovered by Michael Gira, owner of Young God Records, after Siobhan Duffy, Gira's wife, bought a copy of Banhart's demo CD The Charles C. Leary and gave it to Gira. 
Banhart and Gira compiled an album from Banhart's recordings, and in 2002, Oh Me Oh My, which was made up of short fragments, was published by Young God Records and received favorable reviews. He recorded two other albums and an EP for the label: Rejoicing in the Hands, Niño Rojo, and The Black Babies; the releases had a simple acoustic sound. Banhart changed to XL Recordings in 2005 and released Cripple Crow, which was recorded in Bearsville Studios, New York and had a more elaborate sound. 
Additionally in 2005 Devendra collaborated with Antony and the Johnsons on the award-winning album I Am a Bird Now. Banhart sings the introduction to the song Spiraling and plays guitar on You Are My Sister in which Boy George also appears. 
Devendra was the first artist to design a t-shirt for the Yellow Bird Project, back in 2006. He chose to donate the profits from the sale of his T-shirt to the Teenage Cancer Trust. 
He recorded his second album for XL Records, Smokey Rolls Down Thunder Canyon, at his home studio in Topanga, California. The album charted on the Billboard 200 at number 115. The album's song ""Lover"" was featured in the soundtrack of the movie Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist, which included a cameo appearance by Banhart. 

Banhart has performed at Carnegie Hall and the Hollywood Bowl opening for Gilberto Gil, as well as at Bonnaroo and Coachella music festivals. He founded a record label, Gnomonsong, with Andy Cabic of Vetiver, in 2005. In 2007, he signed with Neil Young's manager Elliot Roberts, who also contributed vocals to Smokey Rolls Down Thunder Canyon. 
Banhart released an album in 2008 entitled, Surfing, with Megapuss - a collaborative project with Gregory Rogove and Fabrizio Moretti of The Strokes and Little Joy. Comedian Aziz Ansari is featured on the album's track ""Duck People Duck Man"" under the alias ""Grandpa P Darwish"". 
In 2009, he signed to Warner/Reprise and released, What Will We Be. Later that year, at the band's request, he produced a remix of Oasis' ""(Get Off Your) High Horse Lady"". Along with ""Neighbors"", Devendra remixed the Phoenix song ""Rome"" from their 2009 album Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix. 
On September 4, 2009, Beck announced his second Record Club covers album, Songs of Leonard Cohen. Banhart contributed, alongside MGMT, Andrew Stockdale of Wolfmother and Binki Shapiro of Little Joy. 
He is a collector of music artifacts. Banhart wrote the foreword for and appears in his friend Lauren Dukoff's book Family: Photographs by Lauren Dukoff. He has also written the introduction to a selection of poems by Kenneth Patchen. 
On October 27, 2009, Banhart released What Will We Be, his first record on Warner/Reprise. Banhart and Jon Beasley, who were credited as art directors for the album's artwork and packaging, were nominated for a Grammy in 2011 for Best Recording Package. 
The film Life During Wartime, directed by Todd Solondz, features a musical collaboration between Banhart and Beck. The song plays over the film's end credits. Banhart sings lead vocals while Beck adds backing vocals and also recorded the track. The lyrics were written by Solondz and the music by composer Marc Shaiman. 
Banhart is an avid skateboarder, and in March 2010 broke a bone in his right leg while skating, only hours before a concert in Phoenix, resulting in the cancelation of future shows in Utah and Colorado. 
In 2011, he collaborated with Marisa Monte and Rodrigo Amarante on a version of the song ""Nú Com a Minha Música"" for the Red Hot Organization's most recent charitable album ""Red Hot+Rio 2."" The album is a follow-up to the 1996 ""Red Hot + Rio."" Proceeds from the sales will be donated to raise awareness and money to fight AIDS/HIV and related health and social issues. 
In April 2012, Banhart took place in artist Doug Aitken's audiovisual project ""Song 1"" at the Hirshorn Museum in Washington D.C. Banhart joined Beck and James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem in performing ""I Only Have Eyes For You"" for the project that uses eleven high-definition video projectors working in tandem to blanket the museum's entire surface with a video of the performance. 
On December 3, 2012 Banhart announced his new album, Mala. The album was released on March 12, 2013, and was Banhart's debut album for Nonesuch.

Style:
Banhart's music is often associated with the New Weird America genre, along with Vetiver and Joanna Newsom.The New York Times has called his songs ""free associative work"" and SPIN magazine has written that ""Banhart's albums offer ashram-appropriate guitar strums, trippy-hippie tone poetry."" Various publications have described his style as psych folk,avant-folk, freak folk,Lo-Fi, hipster folk revival, and alternative folk. 
Some reviewers, including AllMusic, The Times, and Mojo, have pointed out similarities between Banhart's songs and production with that of the early 1970s band Tyrannosaurus Rex (an early version of Marc Bolan's T. Rex). In a May 2004 interview with Arthur magazine, Banhart stated that he was unaware of the music of Tyrannosaurus Rex until after he began writing and recording songs. Devendra Banhart instead prefers to credit Vashti Bunyan, Caetano Veloso, Simon Diaz and Arthur Russell among his main influences.]",0.41251255005,0.682077,"[freak folk, new weird america, anti-folk, indie folk, indie christmas, stomp and holler, chamber pop, slow core, folk christmas, lo-fi, neo-psychedelic, indie pop, folk, singer-songwriter, indie rock]",0.666895,0.331995161326,0.696245774146,0.247937703757,0.485291497591,0.146285720948,2.0,0.105856948486,0.687783538561,1.0,0.0340236220135,0.598367222371,4.0,0.736317557893,1

He is best known for his solo career, during which he has released three full-length studio albums, Rock and Roll Night Club (2012), 2 (2012), and Salad Days (2014). His style has been described as ""blue wave"", or ""slacker rock"". 

Life and career:
Mac DeMarco was born on April 30, 1990 in Duncan, British Columbia, and raised in Edmonton, Alberta. During high school he was in several bands, including The Meat Cleavers, The Sound of Love and Outdoor Miners (named after a song by English rock band Wire). His great-grandfather is Vernor Smith, Alberta's former Minister of Railways and Telephones, for whom DeMarco was named. His mother later changed his name to Macbriare Samuel Lanyon DeMarco. 
After DeMarco graduated from high school in Edmonton in 2008, he moved to Vancouver. Living in the Killarney neighbourhood, he released a self-produced album, Heat Wave, calling himself Makeout Videotape in 2009. The album sold out its 500-unit run. DeMarco worked on ""psychedelic"" video projects during this time. He was joined by Alex Calder and Jen Clement, signed to Unfamiliar Records, and toured with Vancouver band Japandroids in 2009. In 2011, DeMarco moved from Vancouver to Montreal to begin recording as a solo artist. Failing to find work as a musician, he participated in medical experiments for money and worked on a road paving crew. In early 2012, he released an EP titled Rock and Roll Nightclub. The four-track-recorded album features skits and slowed-down vocals. It impressed his new label, Captured Tracks, enough that they agreed to release a full-length album. This release, entitled 2, was received well by critics, garnering a ""Best New Music"" designation from Pitchfork Media. One of his songs, ""Moving Like Mike"", was licensed by U.S. retail outlet Target for a commercial. 
On January 21, 2014, DeMarco announced the release of his upcoming second album, Salad Days, along with debuting the lead single ""Passing Out Pieces."" The record was released on April 1, 2014, and again received the ""Best New Music"" designation from Pitchfork. It was a shortlisted nominee for the 2014 Polaris Music Prize. Captured Tracks has announced a subscription series called ""The Wonderful World of Mac DeMarco 7"" Club Vol. 1"". Subscribers will receive two 7"" records every six to eight weeks containing various recordings by DeMarco. 
DeMarco made his fourth talk show appearance when he performed the song ""Let Her Go"" on Conan on March 30, 2015. On April 22, 2015, DeMarco announced the release of an upcoming mini album titled Another One, due for release on August 7, 2015, in addition to a video depicting the making of Another One. On May 11, 2015, Captured Tracks released the first single of Another One, titled ""The Way You'd Love Her"". 

Style:
DeMarco has mentioned Shuggie Otis, Steely Dan, Unknown Mortal Orchestra and Jonathan Richman as favourite artists. His guitar-based compositions have moved from glam-inspired works to what reviewers describe as ""off-kilter pop"". DeMarco has labelled his style as ""jizz jazz.""

Their self-titled debut album was released in 2006 to critical acclaim and has been followed by Devotion in 2008, Teen Dream in 2010, Bloom in 2012, and Depression Cherry in 2015. 

History:

Formation and Beach House:
Vocalist and organist Victoria Legrand, who graduated from Vassar College in 2003, and guitarist Alex Scally formed the band in 2004 after meeting in Baltimore's indie rock scene, producing music composed largely of organ, programmed drums, and slide guitar. Of the origins of the band name, Scally said: ""We'd been writing music, and we had all these songs, and then there was that moment where you say 'what do we call ourselves?' We tried to intellectualize it, and it didn't work. There were different plant-names, Wisteria, that kind of thing. Stupid stuff. But, once we stopped trying, it just came out, it just happened. And it just seemed perfect."" In an interview Pitchfork Media, Legrand addressed their two member status; ""It's a way to challenge ourselves: What do you do when it's just the two of you... One of the reasons this has been such a fulfilling experience for me is that with two people, it's so much easier to achieve things that feel exciting and new."" 
The song ""Apple Orchard"" was featured on a Pitchfork Media MP3 mixtape in August 2006. In October 2006 the band's self-titled debut album, Beach House, was released through Carpark Records. That year, Pitchfork Media ranked it 16th on its Best Albums list. 

Devotion and other projects:
Beach House's second album, Devotion, was released on February 26, 2008. It was received with similar acclaim and was included in Pitchfork's Best Albums of 2008 list. On October 21, 2008, the group released the single ""Used to Be"". 
Beach House also recorded a cover of Queen's ""Play the Game"" for the iTunes Store release of the Red Hot Organization's 2009 compilation, Dark Was The Night. 
In 2009, Legrand provided backing vocals on the song ""Two Weeks"" by the indie rock band Grizzly Bear. She later collaborated with the band again by providing vocals to ""Slow Life"", the band's contribution to the soundtrack for the film Twilight: New Moon. 
In October 2010, the band contributed a charity t-shirt for the Yellow Bird Project to raise money for the House of Ruth women's shelter in Maryland, US for victims of domestic violence. 

Teen Dream:

Teen Dream, the duo's ""dynamic and intense"" third album, was released on Sub Pop on January 26, 2010. The album was released in the UK by Bella Union and in Mexico by Arts & Crafts. It contains a newer version of their 2008 single ""Used to Be"". ""Norway"" was made available as a free download on the band's website on November 17, 2009; and promoted on iTunes as the Free Single of the Week starting January 12, 2010. The album was produced and engineered by Chris Coady (Yeah Yeah Yeahs, TV on the Radio, Grizzly Bear). The album's unanimously good reviews have gained the band a much larger fan base, with Jay-Z and Beyoncé being spotted at the band's shows. 
Teen Dream was listed as No. 5 on Pitchfork's Top 50 Albums of 2010: 
Teen Dream did little to alter Beach House's core characteristics-- slow-motion beats layered with hazy keyboard drones, rippling guitar figures, and Victoria Legrand's melancholic melodies-- but greatly amplified them to the point of redefining the band's essence, from that of introverted knee-gazers into an assured, emotionally assertive force.--Stuart Berman
Of the success of album and it being dubbed the group's ""breakout"" record by numerous publications, Legrand stated: ""I see this as just another step in a direction. I would not want to say that 2010 will be our year, necessarily, I hope it's just another year in which we do good work. I don't want to be defined by this year, I want it to just be a beginning."" 

Bloom:

On March 7, 2012 the band streamed a new song, ""Myth"", from their website. The album Bloom was released on May 15, 2012 via Sub Pop. A second song from the album, ""Lazuli"", was released on April 13, 2012. Beach House was featured on the cover of Issue #80 of the Fader. A music video for ""Lazuli"" was released on June 6, 2012. It was directed by Allen Cordell, who also directed the video for ""Walk in the Park"" from Teen Dream. A music video for the track ""Wild"" has also been released. A music video for ""Wishes"" directed by Eric Wareheim and starring Ray Wise was released on March 7, 2013. 
The band released a short film, Forever Still, on February 4, 2013. The film, directed by the band and Max Goldman, was inspired by Pink Floyd's Live at Pompeii and features the band performing songs from Bloom at various sites around Tornillo, Texas, where the album was recorded. The idea for the film came from the band's desire to make quality promotional content they could control artistically: ""We had previously been involved in too many live sessions, radio tapings, photo shoots, etc., where the outcome was far below our personal artistic standards. We also felt a need to distance ourselves from the 'content' culture of the internet that rewards quantity over quality and shock over nuance."" 

Depression Cherry:
On May 26, 2015 the band announced the release of their fifth album Depression Cherry. The album is slated for release on August 28 via Sub Pop (on Bella Union in the UK) and the band have announced a world tour in support. Talking of the direction of the new album, the band said ""In general, this record shows a return to simplicity, with songs structured around a melody and a few instruments, with live drums playing a far lesser role. With the growing success of Teen Dream and Bloom, the larger stages and bigger rooms naturally drove us towards a louder, more aggressive place; a place farther from our natural tendencies. Here, we continue to let ourselves evolve while fully ignoring the commercial context in which we exist.""  

Musical style and influences:
Singer Victoria Legrand's vocals have often been compared to those of Nico. Some music outlets have also compared Legrand's vocals to 1980s psychedelic rock vocalist Kendra Smith of the band Opal. Guitarist Alex Scally plays a Fender Stratocaster guitar in an E♭ Tuning. The group's influences include This Mortal Coil, Cocteau Twins, The Zombies, Brian Wilson, Françoise Hardy, Neil Young, Big Star, Tony, Caro and John and Chris Bell. 
Beach House re-recorded the Tony, Caro and John song ""Snowdon Song"" and renamed it ""Lovelier Girl"". The song was released on the band's self-titled album with no attribution. Initially, Tony Dore of Tony, Caro and John stated, ""I haven't seen much yet in terms of royalties or acknowledgement of authorship"". Several months later, however, Dore disclosed that discussions had taken place to apply proper attribution on re-releases of the self-titled album. 

Live performances:
The band has toured extensively worldwide. Of touring, Legrand stated: ""We love touring. That's when you get to get into a rhythm, playing every night. It can be really fun. And I think you learn where you want to go with your music."" 
In March 2009, the band was featured at the SXSW festival in Austin, Texas. In April 2010, the band performed at the Coachella Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California. In June 2010, the band surmounted ""technical difficulties due to too much MDMA"" while playing a set on The Park Stage at Glastonbury. In August 2010, the band joined Vampire Weekend on tour as one of their two opening acts, the other being the Dum Dum Girls. In October 2010, Beach House played at the Austin City Limits Music Festival. On December 20, 2010 the band performed on Conan. 
The band was chosen by Animal Collective to perform at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival they curated in May 2011, and also by Portishead to perform at the ATP I'll Be Your Mirror festival that they curated in July 2011 at London's Alexandra Palace. On May 29, 2011 the band played at the Sasquatch! Music Festival. On July 31, 2011 the band played at the Fuji Rock music festival in Niigata, Japan. On October 16, 2011, the band played at the Treasure Island Music Festival. On May 18, 2012, they appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman and on Sunday July 15, 2012, they performed the closing set on the Red Stage during the Pitchfork Music Festival. 
In May 2012, the band appeared on Later... with Jools Holland playing ""Myth"" and ""Lazuli"" from their 2012 album, Bloom. On July 26, 2012 they performed the Bloom cuts ""Wild"" and ""Wishes"" on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.

The band's classic lineup consists of Bernard Sumner (vocals, guitar, keyboards), Peter Hook (bass, electronic percussion), Gillian Gilbert (keyboards, guitar) and Stephen Morris (drums, keyboards). The group effectively disbanded in 1993 but reformed in 1998. Gilbert left in 2001 to look after her and Morris' children and was replaced by guitarist/keyboardist Phil Cunningham. Hook left acrimoniously in 2007 and declared the band to be defunct. Initially, Sumner, Cunningham and Morris denied the band had split up, but in 2009, following the release of the trio's Bad Lieutenant album, they admitted that that they could not continue on without Hook and officially disbanded. However, the band reformed in 2011 for a pair of charity dates without Hook, with Gilbert returning to the fold and Tom Chapman replacing Hook on bass.   Pioneers of dance music in the 1980s and one of the first bands to effectively and popularly synthesize keyboard- and guitar-based music, New Order's members hailed from Salford and Macclesfield, England out of the ashes of Joy Division, are noted as being one of the first bands to bridge the gap between post-punk and dancefloor. They were Factory Records' highest selling artist. They also funded Factory's famous Manchester club, The Haçienda. The band partnered with Quincy Jones's American label Qwest, recorded with legendary hip-hop producer Arthur Baker (on 1983's single ""Confusion"" and 1984's ""Thieves Like Us""), and they embraced Ibizan club culture on the album, Technique.  The band was formed in 1980 by the three surviving members, Bernard Sumner, Peter Hook and Stephen Morris of Joy Division after the lead singer Ian Curtis committed suicide. Morris' girlfriend (and later wife) Gillian Gilbert joined in October 1980 on keyboards and occasional guitar shortly after contributing guitar to the second release of New Order's first single ""Ceremony"". Their early music followed in the same vein as Joy Division, most notably on debut album Movement. This is mostly seen now as a 'transitional' album where the new 4-piece band was trying to find a new identity.  They continued to develop their music and their identity with tracks such as ""Procession"" and ""Temptation"" until 1983 when, under the influence of early electro funk and Italo-Disco tracks (most notably Klein & MBO's Dirty Talk), they released ""Blue Monday"", arguably their most famous song and the biggest-selling 12"" single of all time. This came in such a detailed Peter Saville-designed sleeve (replicating a floppy disc) that it is claimed by some that the band's record company, Factory, lost money on every copy sold.   The release of ""Blue Monday"" coincided with the album Power, Corruption & Lies which further developed their dance/rock crossover. Other albums followed in 1985 (Low-Life), 1986 (Brotherhood) and 1989 (Technique, influenced heavily by Ibiza's acid house scene). In 1990 the band scored their sole number 1 hit with a song written by Keith Allen and performed with the England football team, ""World in Motion"", the official England World Cup song.  One more album, Republic followed in May 1993, which was released by London Records after the collapse of Factory in November 1992.  The band effectively split in 1993 to pursue solo projects, but returned with a triumphant gig at the Reading Festival in 1998. After the recording of 2001's Get Ready album Gillian Gilbert left the band amicably for family reasons - her and Stephen's daughter Grace had been diagnosed with Transverse myelitis and she came to the decision that it would be easier for the band to replace her than her husband. They have since gone on to produce one more album with the help of Phil Cunningham of Marion when they released their last album, Waiting for the Sirens' Call.  Hook left acrimoniously in 2007 and according to him, the band has effectively broken up. However, Sumner, Cunningham and Morris repeatedly denied that the band was over, and that if Hook no longer wanted to be in the band, that was his choice. Hook has since threatened to take legal action if they attempt to continue as New Order. In 2009, Sumner, Morris and Cunningham announced that they did not plan on continuing on as New Order without Hook. However, in September 2011 it was announced that they will reform as New Order for two concerts in October (Brussels and Paris), without Hook but with Gillian Gilbert. Hook's replacement is Tom Chapman, who is also in Bad Lieutenant with Sumner, Morris and Cunningham. The charity gigs in Brussels and Paris were very successful and New Order decided to go on tour in 2012. They played various concerts all over the world and also some big festivals in the summer.  Discography (studio albums): Movement (1981) Power, Corruption & Lies (1983) Low-Life (1985) Brotherhood (1986) Technique (1989) Republic (1993) Get Ready (2001) Waiting for the Sirens' Call (2005)   Collaborations and other projects: Shortly after the split, Sumner and Cunningham formed Bad Lieutenant. The band's debut album Never Cry Another Tear, released in 2009, features Morris on drums on several tracks, although he is not an official member of the band and has committed to continue musical projects with Gillian Gilbert. The band's various solo projects understandably seemed to contain elements of the New Order 'sound', and gave some clues as to each member's contribution to the band.  Bernard Sumner worked with Johnny Marr (formerly of The Smiths) and Neil Tennant (of The Pet Shop Boys) in the 'supergroup', Electronic. Peter Hook formed the bands Revenge and, later, Monaco. These projects gained some commercial success. Stephen Morris and Gillian Gilbert recorded two albums of songs as The Other Two, and also did scoring work for film and television.   Each of New Order's four original members have, at various times, acted as producers and/or guest musicians under the moniker of Be Music for a myriad of Factory labelmates and other artists, including: Section 25, A Certain Ratio, Happy Mondays, Paul Haig, The Stockholm Monsters, The Stone Roses, and stanton miranda., Manchester (UK) quartet whose wide-ranging influences combined with genuine songwriting ..., Born in the early 1980s out of the ashes of ..., Rising from the ashes of the legendary British post-punk unit ..., TOTAL - From Joy Division to New Order is available ..., Rising from the ashes of the legendary British post-punk unit ..., Rising from the ashes of the legendary British post-punk unit ..., Biography by Jason Ankeny Rising from the ashes of the ..., New Order are an English rock band formed in 1980 and currently consisting of Bernard Sumner, Stephen Morris, Gillian Gilbert, Phil Cunningham and Tom Chapman. The band was formed in 1980 by Sumner (vocals, guitars, keyboards and synthesisers), Peter Hook (bass and vocals) and Morris (drums, electronic drums, keyboards and synthesisers) - the remaining members of Joy Division, following the suicide of vocalist Ian Curtis - with the addition of Gilbert (keyboards, synthesisers and guitars). 
By combining post-punk and electronic dance music, New Order became one of the most critically acclaimed and influential bands of the 1980s. Though the band's early years were shadowed by the legacy and basic sound of Joy Division, their experience of the early 1980s New York City club scene increased their knowledge of dance music and helped them incorporate elements of that style into their work. The band's 1983 hit ""Blue Monday"", the best-selling 12-inch single of all time, is one example of how the band transformed their sound. 
New Order were the flagship band for Manchester-based independent record label Factory Records. Their minimalist album sleeves and ""non-image"" (the band rarely gave interviews and were known for performing short concert sets with no encores) reflected the label's aesthetic of doing whatever the relevant parties wanted to do, including an aversion to including singles as album tracks. 
In 1993 the band worked on their own individual projects and reunited as a band in 1998. In 2001, Cunningham (guitars, keyboards and synthesisers) replaced Gilbert, who took a sabbatical from the band because of family commitments. In 2007, Peter Hook left the band. After Hook's departure, Bernard, Phil and Steve worked on Bad Lieutenant and the band reunited in 2011 without Hook, with Gilbert's return and Chapman replacing Hook on bass. During the band's career and in between lengthy breaks, band members have been involved in several solo projects, such as Sumner's Electronic and Bad Lieutenant; Hook's Monaco and Revenge and Gilbert and Morris' The Other Two. Cunningham was previously a member of Marion and with Sumner and Chapman was a member of Bad Lieutenant. 

History:

Origins and formation: 1977-1980:
Between 1977 and 1980, Ian Curtis, Peter Hook, Stephen Morris, and Bernard Sumner were members of the post-punk band Joy Division, often featuring heavy production input from producer Martin Hannett. Curtis committed suicide on 18 May 1980, the day before Joy Division were scheduled to depart for their first American tour, and prior to release of the band's second album, Closer. The rest of the band decided soon after Curtis's death that they would carry on. Prior to his death, the members of Joy Division had agreed not to continue under the Joy Division name should any one member leave. On 29 July 1980, the still unnamed trio debuted live at Manchester's Beach Club.Rob Gretton, the band's manager for over twenty years, is credited for having found the name ""New Order"" in an article in The Guardian entitled ""The People's New Order of Kampuchea"". The band adopted this name, despite its previous use for ex-Stooge Ron Asheton's band The New Order. The group states that the name New Order (as was also the case with ""Joy Division"") does not draw a direct line to Nazism or Fascism. 
The band rehearsed with each member taking turns on vocals. Sumner ultimately took the role, as he could sing when he wasn't playing his guitar. Wanting to complete the line-up with someone they knew well and whose musical skill and style was compatible with their own, New Order invited Morris's girlfriend, Gillian Gilbert from Macclesfield, to join the band in early October 1980, as keyboardist and guitarist. Gilbert's membership was suggested by Gretton. Gilbert's first live performance with New Order occurred at The Squat in Manchester on 25 October 1980. 

Movement: 1981-1982:
The initial release as New Order was the single ""Ceremony"", backed with ""In a Lonely Place"". These two songs were written in the weeks before Curtis took his own life. With the release of Movement in November 1981, New Order initially started on a similar route as their previous incarnation, performing dark, melodic songs, albeit with an increased use of synthesisers. The band viewed the period as a low point, as they were still reeling from Curtis' death. Hook commented that the only positive thing to come out of the Movement sessions was that producer Martin Hannett had showed the band how to use a mixing board, which allowed them to produce records by themselves from then on. More recently, Hook indicated a change of heart: ""I think Movement gets a raw deal in general really - for me, when you consider the circumstances in which it was written, it is a fantastic record."" 
New Order visited New York City again in 1981, where the band were introduced to post-disco, Latin freestyle, and electro. The band had taken to listening to Italian disco to cheer themselves up, while Morris taught himself drum programming. The singles that followed, ""Everything's Gone Green"" and ""Temptation"", saw a change in direction toward dance music. 
The Haçienda, Factory Records' own nightclub (largely funded by New Order) opened in May 1982 in Manchester and was even issued a Factory catalogue number: FAC51. The opening of UK's first ever superclub was marked by a nearly 23-minute instrumental piece originally entitled ""Prime 5 8 6"", but released 15 years later as ""Video 5 8 6"". Composed primarily by Sumner and Morris, ""Prime 5 8 6""/""Video 5 8 6"" was an early version of ""5 8 6"" that contained rhythm elements that would later surface on ""Blue Monday"" and ""Ultraviolence"". 

Power, Corruption & Lies: 1983-1984:
Power, Corruption & Lies, released in May 1983, was a synthesiser-based outing and a dramatic change in sound from Joy Division and the preceding album, although the band had been hinting at the increased use of technology during the music-making process for a number of years then, including their work as Joy Division. Starting from what earlier singles had hinted, this was where the band had found their footing, mixing early techno music with their earlier guitar-based sound and showing the strong influence of acts like Kraftwerk and Giorgio Moroder. Even further in this direction was the electronically sequenced, four-on-the-floor single ""Blue Monday"". Inspired by Klein & MBO's ""Dirty Talk"" and Sylvester's disco classic, ""You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)"", ""Blue Monday"" became the best-selling independent 12"" single of all time in the UK; however, (much to the chagrin of the buying public) it was not on the track list of Power, Corruption & Lies. This resulted in a sticker being applied to unsold copies of Power, Corruption & Lies album saying, ""DOES NOT CONTAIN BLUE MONDAY"". (It was included on the cassette format in some countries, such as Australia and New Zealand.) ""Blue Monday"" is now included on the 2008 collector's edition of Power, Corruption & Lies. 
The 1983 single ""Confusion"" firmly established the group as a dance music force, inspiring many musicians in subsequent years. In 1984 they followed the largely synthesised single ""Thieves Like Us"" with the heavy guitar-drum-bass rumble of ""Murder"", a not-too-distant cousin of ""Ecstasy"" from the Power, Corruption & Lies album. 

Low-Life, Brotherhood, and Substance: 1985-1987:
1985's Low-Life refined and sometimes mixed the two styles, brandishing ""The Perfect Kiss""--the video for which was filmed by Jonathan Demme--and ""Sub-culture"". In February 1986, the soundtrack album to Pretty in Pink featuring ""Shellshock"" was released on A&M Records. An instrumental version of ""Thieves Like Us"" and the instrumental ""Elegia"" appeared in the film but were not on the soundtrack album. Later that summer, New Order headlined a line-up that included the Smiths, the Fall, and A Certain Ratio during the Festival of the Tenth Summer at Manchester's G-Mex. 
Brotherhood (1986) divided the two approaches onto separate album sides. The album notably featured ""Bizarre Love Triangle"" and ""Angel Dust"" (of which a remixed instrumental version is available on the UK ""True Faith"" CD video single, under the title ""Evil Dust""), a track which marries a synth break beat with Low-Life-era guitar effects. While New Order toured North America with friends Echo & the Bunnymen, the summer of 1987 saw the release of the compilation Substance, which featured the new single ""True Faith"". Substance was an important album in collecting the group's 12-inch singles onto CD for the first time and featured new versions of ""Temptation"" and ""Confusion""--referred to as ""Temptation '87"" and ""Confusion '87"". A second disc featured several of the B-sides from the singles on the first disc, as well as additional A-sides ""Procession"" and ""Murder"". The single, ""True Faith"", with its surreal video, became a hit on MTV and the band's first American top 40 hit. The single's B-side, ""1963""--originally planned on being the A-side until the group's label convinced them to release ""True Faith"" instead--would later be released as a single in its own right several years later, with two new versions. 
In December 1987, the band released a further single, ""Touched by the Hand of God"", with a Katherine Bigelow-directed video parodying glam-metal. The single reached number 20 on the UK Singles Chart and number 1 in the UK Independent Singles chart, but would not appear on album until the 1994 compilation The Best of New Order. 

Technique, Republic and first break-up: 1988-1993:
By this time, the group was heavily influenced by the Balearic sounds of Ibiza making their way into the Hacienda. Partly recorded at Mediterranean Sound studios on Ibiza, Technique was released in February 1989. The album entered the charts at number one in the UK and contained a mix of the acid house influence (as on ""Fine Time"", which is the opening track on the album) and a more traditional rock sound on others (such as the single ""Run 2""). The album is a blend of occasionally upbeat, accessible music coupled with blunt, poignant lyrics. During the summer of 1989, New Order supported Technique by touring with Public Image Ltd, Throwing Muses and The Sugarcubes across the United States and Canada in what was the press dubbed the ""Monsters of Alternative Rock"" tour. Also New Order recorded the official song of the England national football team's 1990 World Cup campaign, ""World in Motion"", under the ad-hoc band name EnglandNewOrder. The song, co-written with comedian Keith Allen, was a number one UK hit. 
New Order never had a formal contract with their label Factory Records, which is unusual for any major group. (This was in fact the label's standard practice until the mid-1980s. According to Factory's co-founder Tony Wilson, ""All our bands are free to fuck off whenever they please."") Because of this, the group (rather than Factory Records) legally owned all their own recorded material. This has often been cited, not least by Wilson himself, as the main reason London Records' 1992 offer to buy the ailing label fell through. 
Republic, released around the world in 1993, was the band's first album release since parting company with the now-defunct Factory Records. The release spawned the singles ""Regret""--their highest-charting single in the US--""Ruined in a Day"", ""World"", and ""Spooky"". 
Following the release of Republic, the band put New Order on hold while each member continued on with their own side-projects. In 1994, a second singles collection was released, entitled The Best of New Order. It featured all of the band's singles since Substance as well as a few extra tracks: ""Vanishing Point"" (from 1989's Technique), ""The Perfect Kiss"", ""Thieves Like Us"", ""Shellshock"", and new recordings of ""True Faith"", ""Bizarre Love Triangle"", ""1963"" and ""Round & Round"". The new versions of ""True Faith"" and ""1963"" - the latter with a yet newer, more guitar-oriented version produced by Arthur Baker - were released as singles to promote the album. In the US, the track listing was altered to set it apart from Substance as well as the UK release of The Best of New Order which had been available months prior. This collection was followed by a remix album, The Rest of New Order, featuring a selection of old remixes and newly commissioned mixes of classic New Order tracks. Some versions contained an extra disc/cassette composed entirely of remixes of ""Blue Monday"". ""Blue Monday"" was released as a single for a third time to promote the collection. 

Reformation and Get Ready: 1998-2003:
The group reconvened in 1998 at the suggestion of Rob Gretton. Nearly five years had passed since they had last seen each other. Sumner said, ""We decided before we agreed to doing any gig, to have a meeting, and if anyone had any grudges to bear, to iron them out."" By the second meeting everyone agreed to continue playing, scheduling their reunion gig for the Phoenix Festival that same year. In addition to rarer songs, New Order also decided to begin playing Joy Division songs again. When the Phoenix Festival was cancelled due to low ticket sales, New Order instead played the last night of that year's Reading Festival. 
Their 2001 release Get Ready largely departed from their more electronic style and focused on the more guitar oriented music. According to Sumner, ""Get Ready was guitar-heavy simply because we felt that we'd left that instrument alone for a long time."" Longtime fan Billy Corgan of The Smashing Pumpkins played guitar and sang back-up on the track ""Turn My Way"", and in 2001 toured with the band on dates in the UK, US, and Japan for a short period of time. Phil Cunningham (formerly of Marion) joined the band in a live capacity, deputising for Gilbert who declined to tour in favour of caring for her and Morris' children. Primal Scream's Bobby Gillespie provided vocals on the track ""Rock the Shack"". Singles from the album included ""Crystal"", ""60 Miles an Hour"", and ""Someone Like You"". 
In 2002, Q featured New Order on their list of the ""50 Bands to See Before You Die"", although this was as part of a sub-list of ""5 Bands That Could Go Either Way"". Both New Order and Joy Division were portrayed in the Michael Winterbottom film 24 Hour Party People, depicting the rise and fall of Factory Records as seen through the eyes of label founder Tony Wilson. Cameos by Wilson himself, along with Mark E. Smith of The Fall and former members of Happy Mondays and Inspiral Carpets, lent a degree of legitimacy to the proceedings. The film touched on some of Factory's other artists, including Happy Mondays and The Durutti Column. The soundtrack featured Get Ready-era Chemical Brothers-produced ""Here to Stay"", which was released as a single. The DVD release of the single highlighted scenes taken from the film. 

Waiting for the Sirens' Call, Singles and second break-up: 2004-2007:
The band released a new album on 27 March 2005, entitled Waiting for the Sirens' Call, their first with new member Phil Cunningham. Cunningham replaced Gilbert (now married to Morris) so she could look after their children. Singles from this album were ""Krafty"", ""Jetstream"" (which features guest vocals by Ana Matronic from Scissor Sisters), and the title track. At the 2005 NME Awards, New Order and Joy Division received the award for ""Godlike Geniuses"" (for lifetime achievement). Previous winners include Ozzy Osbourne, The Clash, and Happy Mondays. In 2006 the album track ""Guilt Is a Useless Emotion"" was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category of Best Dance Recording. 
In the autumn of 2005, the group released another greatest hits compilation, in the form of Singles. The two-disc release was an updated version of the Substance collection and contained every single released from their 1981 debut all the way through to ""Waiting for the Sirens' Call"". However, unlike Substance, which focused almost exclusively on the 12"" versions of the group's singles, Singles collected the 7"" versions, many of which (like ""Ceremony"", ""Temptation"" and ""Confusion"") had never been released on CD. The album was accompanied by a two-disc DVD set, entitled Item, that collected the extended UK version of NewOrderStory with a DVD of all New Order music videos as well as two newly commissioned videos for ""Temptation '87"" and ""Ceremony"". 
The New Order: Live in Glasgow DVD was recorded at the Glasgow Academy in 2006 and features 18 tracks, including 4 Joy Division songs. Next to that, the release also contains a bonus disc of footage from the band's personal archive including 1980s footage from Glastonbury, Rome, Cork, Rotterdam and Toronto. 
In 2006, the band played several one-off live dates as well as short tours in the UK, Brazil and Argentina. At the end of the Buenos Aires show in November 2006, Peter Hook suggested that the band should stop touring. In early May 2007, bassist Peter Hook was interviewed by British radio station XFM - originally to talk about his contribution to the debut album of former Jane's Addiction singer Perry Farrell's new band Satellite Party saying that ""...me and Bernard Sumner aren't working together."" Further complicating the news, NewOrderOnline, a website with support from New Order management, reported that, according to ""a source close to the band,"" ""the news about the split is false... New Order still exists despite what Hook said .... Peter Hook can leave the band, but this doesn't mean the end of New Order."" The band however dissolved and Sumner revealed in 2009 that he no longer wished to make music as New Order. 

Reunion with new line-up, Lost Sirens: 2011-present:
In September 2011, the band announced that they would perform for the first time since 2006, at the Ancienne Belgique, Brussels on 17 October and at the Bataclan, Paris on 18 October. The band's line-up included keyboardist Gillian Gilbert, who returned to the band after a ten-year break, and Bad Lieutenant bassist Tom Chapman in place of Peter Hook. They played subsequent shows in London and South America in December. 
In December 2011, New Order released Live at the London Troxy, a live album from their performance of 10 December 2011 at The Troxy in London. This release featured the new lineup and their first show in London in over five years. 
They continued to tour throughout 2012, including a short tour of New Zealand and Australia in February/March. They played at the 'T in the Park' festival in Scotland on 3 and 4 July 2012 and at the EXIT Festival in Novi Sad Serbia on 13 July 2012. New Order performed at Hyde Park with Blur and The Specials to celebrate the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony. 
In December 2012 it was announced that Lost Sirens would be released in the United Kingdom on 14 January 2013. Lost Sirens is an eight-track album of tracks left out of Waiting for the Sirens' Call. The album was discussed by Gillian Gilbert in a Brazilian interview to promote the band's appearance in São Paulo. She acknowledged issues with former member Peter Hook, and stated there was ""a lot going on behind the scenes on the copyright"" delaying the release. 
The band debuted their first newly-written song since the Waiting for the Sirens' Call sessions during Lollapalooza Chile in March 2014. The song was initially performed without an official name, but now has a confirmed title of ""Singularity."" In July, the group toured North America, where they debuted the song ""Plastic"". On 2 September it was announced that the band decided to release their new album through Mute Records. The New Order catalogue remains with Warner Music. . 

Other projects:
In 1988, Bernard Sumner teamed up with former Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr for the Electronic project (also enlisting the help of Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe of the Pet Shop Boys). Sumner worked with Marr in 1996 for second time in Electronic for Raise the Pressure. Karl Bartos (formerly of Kraftwerk) also assisted with this record. The project's third album Twisted Tenderness was released in 1999 after which the band dissolved. 
In June 2009, Bernard Sumner formed a new band called Bad Lieutenant with Phil Cunningham (guitar) and Jake Evans (guitar and vocals), that completed an album, Never Cry Another Tear, which was released on 5 October 2009. In addition to Cunningham and Evans the album also features appearances by Stephen Morris (drums), Jack Mitchell (drums), Tom Chapman (bass) and Alex James (bass). The live band includes Morris on drums and Tom Chapman on bass. 
Hook has been involved with several other projects. In the 1990s, Hook recorded with Killing Joke with a view to joining the band. However, original bassist Martin 'Youth' Glover instead returned to the band. In 1995 he toured with The Durutti Column. He has recorded one album with the band Revenge and two with Monaco (both as bassist, keyboardist and lead vocalist) with David Potts, the latter of which scored a club and alternative radio hit ""What Do You Want From Me?"" in 1997. He also worked on a new band project called Freebass with bass players Mani (The Stone Roses) and Andy Rourke (ex-The Smiths), active from 2007 to 2010. He also contributed to Perry Farrell's Satellite Party. Currently, Hook's new band The Light, is touring playing Joy Division's albums and New Order first 2 albums. 
In 1990 Gilbert and Morris formed their own band, The Other Two. The Other Two released its first single ""Tasty Fish"" in 1991 and released two albums, The Other Two & You in 1993 and Super Highways 1999. In 2007, Gilbert and Morris remixed two tracks for the Nine Inch Nails remixes album Year Zero Remixed. 

BeMusic:
""BeMusic"" was a name the band used for their publishing company (and the LP label for Movement says ""B Music"" in large letters, though using an italic ß for the letter B). All four members of the band used the name for production work for other artists' recordings between 1982 and 1985. 
The first BeMusic credit was for Peter Hook producing Stockholm Monsters in 1982. Other artists with producer or musician credit for ""BeMusic"" were 52nd Street, Section 25, Marcel King, Quando Quango, Paul Haig, Thick Pigeon, Nyam Nyam and Life. 
Their production work as BeMusic was collected on two LTM Recordings compilation CDs, Cool As Ice: The BeMusic Productions and Twice As Nice (which also included production work by Donald Johnson, of A Certain Ratio, and Arthur Baker). 

Sound:
Both New Order and Joy Division were among the most successful artists on the Factory Records label, run by Granada television personality Tony Wilson, and partnered with Factory in the financing of the Manchester club The Haçienda. The band rarely gave interviews in the 1980s, later ascribing this to not wanting to discuss Curtis. This, along with the Peter Saville sleeve designs and the tendency to give short performances with no encores, gave New Order a reputation as standoffish. The band became more open in the '90s; for example, the aforementioned NewOrderStory (and in particular the longer UK version) featured extensive personal interviews. 
Their music mixes rock with dance music, as can be seen on signature tracks such as ""True Faith"" and ""Temptation"". This synthesis laid down the groundwork for dance-rock groups of today. The group's album art earned them the status of icons in the alternative community, and has shown considerable longevity. The band are also regarded as the first alternative dance music group with their fusion of ""used icy, gloomy post-punk with Kraftwerk-style synth-pop"" and were also labeled as synthpop, post-punk,new wave, and dance-rock. 
They have heavily influenced techno, rock, and pop musicians including Pet Shop Boys, The Killers and Moby, and were themselves influenced by the likes of David Bowie, Neu!, Kraftwerk, Cabaret Voltaire and Giorgio Moroder. They have also significantly influenced electro, freestyle and house. The Kraftwerk influence was acknowledged by their single ""Krafty"", which had cover art referencing ""Autobahn"". Bassist Peter Hook contributed to New Order's sound by developing an idiosyncratic bass guitar technique. He often used the bass as a lead instrument, playing melodies on the high strings with a signature heavy chorus effect, leaving the ""actual"" basslines to keyboards or sequencers. This has often been cited as the defining characteristic of the New Order sound. 
Drummer Stephen Morris regularly played a mixture of acoustic and electronic drums, and in many cases played along seamlessly with sequenced parts. All the band members could and did switch instruments throughout gigs, as evidenced on Jonathan Demme's video for ""The Perfect Kiss"" and the fairly common Taras Shevchenko and Pumped Full of Drugs concert videos. In particular, Gilbert, Morris, and Sumner could be seen playing keyboards at times, while Hook played electronic drums variously. (Taras Shevchenko is especially notable for the fact all four members of the group have left the stage before the final song (""Temptation"") comes to an end.) 

Album covers:
Almost all New Order recordings bore the minimalist packaging of Peter Saville. The group's record sleeves bucked the 1980s trend by rarely showing the band members (the Low-Life album was the exception) or even providing basic information such as the band name or the title of the release. Song names were often hidden within the shrink wrapped package, either on the disc itself (such as the ""Blue Monday"" single) or on an inconspicuous part of an inner sleeve (""The Perfect Kiss"" single), or a cryptic colour code invented by Saville (Power, Corruption & Lies). Saville said his intention was to sell the band as a ""mass-produced secret"" of sorts, and that the minimalist style was enough to allow fans to identify the band's products without explicit labelling. Saville frequently sent the artwork straight to the printer, unreviewed by either the band or the label.

Band of Horses' fourth studio album, Mirage Rock, was released in September 2012. 

History:

Formation and Everything All the Time (2004-2006):

Ben Bridwell (vocals, guitar) formed Band of Horses in 2004 after the break-up of his previous band, Carissa's Wierd, along with bassist Chris Early and drummer Tim Meinig. They were soon joined by former Carissa's Wierd bandleader Mat Brooke (guitar, vocals). The band initially received attention from Sub Pop after opening for Iron & Wine during Seattle area shows. In 2005, the band released the Tour EP, which was sold at shows and on Sub Pop's website. 
Their first full-length album, Everything All the Time, was recorded in 2005 with producer Phil Ek and released by Sub Pop on March 21, 2006. It features the band's original four-piece lineup, although both Tim Meinig and Sera Cahoone receive drumming credits. The album included new versions of five of the six songs from the Tour EP along with five brand new songs. It was a minor hit in Scandinavia, entering the lower reaches of the Sweden and Norway album charts. Ben Bridwell explained the sound of the album, ""I thought before recording that I really wanted an ELO-sounding record, with strings and keyboards and synths, but then, as we got closer to it, we wanted to take a more raw approach."" 
Bridwell found that there was a personality clash between himself and Meinig and Early and the two left soon after the recording of the album. Ben explained his side of the story, ""All of a sudden I was...with two guys I didn't really even know...they were nice guys, there just wasn't a personality match."" For the subsequent tour, Joe Arnone (guitar and keyboards), Rob Hampton (bass and guitar) and Creighton Barrett (drums) were brought in to play with Bridwell and Brooke. 
Everything All the Time's first single was ""The Funeral"", which has been used in numerous television series, films, video games, and advertisements. On July 13, 2006, the band performed the song on the Late Show with David Letterman without Brooke, who had left the band. He subsequently formed Grand Archives, who have since signed to Sub Pop and released two albums. Brooke explained how he joined Band of Horses, ""So they ended up getting a show opening up for Iron and Wine in Seattle and Ben asked if I would just come up and do a couple songs, just 'cause we're friends. So...I did that. It was fun and then a couple of Iron and Wine tours came up...and then next thing I knew, we were in the studio making a record for Sub Pop."" On why he left, he said, ""I'd never really given the commitment to be a formal member. It was just a spur of the moment...and Everything All the Time took off really fast...I still didn't feel quite committed. It was still 100 percent Ben's project and I kinda wanted to see what else I could do."" 

Cease to Begin (2007-2009):

Before recording their second album, Bridwell decided to relocate the band from Seattle to his native South Carolina. He said, ""We were touring so much that nowhere was really home, so I figured...if I'm gonna come home after these long stretches of traveling, it would nice to be around my family."" 
Band of Horses toured Europe and North America in 2007, prior to the release of their second album. Joe Arnone was no longer part of the band, which now toured as a six-piece band following the addition of Matt Gentling (Archers of Loaf - bass), Robin Peringer (Modest Mouse, Carissa's Wierd - guitar) and Ryan Monroe (keyboards) to the line up. The album, Cease to Begin, was recorded in North Carolina and produced by Phil Ek. It was released by Sub Pop Records on October 9, 2007. The album features the core trio of Ben Bridwell, Creighton Barrett and Rob Hampton, with keyboards played by Ryan Monroe.Cease to Begin gave Band of Horses their first hit in the U.S. by reaching number 35 on the Billboard 200 and was also a hit in Norway, Denmark, France and Sweden. It was voted ninth best album of 2007 by Paste magazine and 47th best by Rolling Stone. The single ""No One's Gonna Love You"" gave Band of Horses their first European hit single, reaching number 22 in Denmark. 
Following the release of Cease to Begin, Monroe became a permanent member of the band, along with new recruits Tyler Ramsey (guitar and vocals) and Bill Reynolds (bass). This once again made Band of Horses a six-piece band. In addition to his role in the band, Ramsey often performs solo as the opening act before the band play live. 
In 2008, Band of Horses played at the Glastonbury Festival, T in the Park, the Bridge School Benefit concert, and the Roskilde Festival. 

Infinite Arms (2010-2011):

In May 2009, producer Phil Ek stated that he was recording the third Band of Horses album in North Carolina. Ben Bridwell mentioned that the new album was titled Night Rainbows several times while introducing new songs during the band's summer 2009 tour, but in a March 2, 2010 interview, the band revealed that the album was to be called Infinite Arms. Prior to the recording of the album, Rob Hampton left the band. He was later replaced by Swedish guitarist Ludwig Böss, although Böss does not appear on the album and on March 19, 2010 it was revealed that he too had left. The album was recorded by the current five-piece lineup of Bridwell, Ramsey, Reynolds, Barrett, and Monroe. 
Infinite Arms was released worldwide between May 14 and 19, 2010 on the Columbia, Brown, and Fat Possum labels. Aside from the North Carolina sessions at Echo Mountain Studios, parts of the album were recorded in Los Angeles at Perfect Sound Studios. The album was self-produced by the band, with additional production from Phil Ek. On April 14, the band performed a full set for the WDR TV show ""Rockpalast"". On April 20, the band appeared on the BBC television series Later... with Jools Holland, promoting Infinite Arms by playing new songs ""Compliments,"" ""Factory"", and ""NW Apt"". Following this appearance, the band's two earlier albums entered the UK Albums Chart for the first time.Infinite Arms entered the UK chart at number 21, giving Band of Horses their first top 100 UK chart hit and debuted at number 7 on the Billboard 200, far exceeding the performance of Cease to Begin. An outtake from the album, ""Life on Earth"" has been used on the soundtrack of the Twilight Saga film Eclipse, which was released on June 7, 2010. 
Band of Horses toured Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand and Japan in 2010. They opened for Pearl Jam on their tour of the Midwest and East Coast and for Snow Patrol at their concerts in Bangor and Glasgow in June. They played the SXSW, Sasquatch, Splendour in the Grass, Summer Sonic, Pukkelpop, Highfields, Malmo, Rock en Seine, Reading, Leeds, ACL and Farm Aid festivals in 2010. 
On October 7, 2010 Band of Horses released a cover of Cee Lo Green's ""Georgia"" via their official website. Ben Bridwell explained, ""This began as a very random idea I had on my dad's patio after we watched our beloved Georgia Bulldogs football team get robbed of a win at the hands of the referees and LSU last year. I knew I wanted to pay homage to my favorite team in song but didn't have any idea how to begin. Once I heard Cee Lo's 'Georgia' I was immediately smitten and figured that's as good as any tribute to any state I've ever heard. It wasn't until I heard his cover of our song though that it occurred to me: Duh, we should return the favor. Incorporating the Redcoat marching band was just the icing on the cake! This song is so nostalgic to me as my parents grew up in Atlanta and have so many family members in the great state of Georgia. It's always been a second home of sorts. We've played some great shows there as well, including our run of annual New Year's Eve shows in Atlanta from 2007-2009."" The cover version Ben referred to is Cee Lo's version of ""No One's Gonna Love You"". The two tracks were released together as a 7-inch vinyl split single. 
Band of Horses released a video for their song ""Dilly"" on November 16, 2010. Previous videos for songs from Infinite Arms had been collections of still photographs by the band's longtime collaborator Christoper Wilson, merged to make movies. ""Dilly"" was shot in the Mojave Desert by director Phil Andelman and was exclusively premiered on the movie website IMDb. The video features the exploits of a trouble-making motorcycle gang, and includes surreal sequences of the gang dancing in formation, as well as them killing people by shooting them with nothing more than a pointed finger. The collaboration with IMDb represents the first occasion that the website has premiered a music video. ""Dilly"" was released as a single on February 14, 2011 and includes the band's cover version of Cee-Lo Green's ""Georgia"". The single was a minor hit on the Belgian (Flanders) singles chart. 
Infinite Arms was nominated for a Grammy Award in the Best Alternative Album category and featured in several end of year ""Best Albums of 2010"" lists, including Q Magazine (#21),NPR Listeners (#15),Filter Magazine (#10) and Paste Magazine (#14). The song ""Laredo"" was placed at number 28 in Rolling Stone Magazine's top 50 songs of 2010. 
In 2011, Band of Horses returned to Europe for a tour in January and February, which included a show with Foo Fighters at Wembley Arena on February 25. They undertook a brief US tour in early April before returning to Europe for several festivals in June. The band were scheduled to support Kings Of Leon on their US tour from July to September 2011 and their eight Australian concerts in November 2011, but Kings of Leon cancelled their US tour after just 3 shows. In 2012 the band toured for the first time in South America. 

Mirage Rock (2012-2013):
In April 2012, Ben Bridwell revealed that Band Of Horses' fourth studio album was scheduled for release in late 2012 and would be produced by Glyn Johns. In June the band shared a video preview, via Facebook and YouTube, of a new song, ""Dumpster World,"" and announced a September release for the album. On July 10 the album's title was confirmed as Mirage Rock and the tracklisting and artwork were revealed. A debut single from the fourth album, ""Knock Knock"", was released on July 9, 2012 and the album was released on September 18. ""Knock Knock"" and the subsequent single from Mirage Rock, ""Slow Cruel Hands of Time"", were both minor hits in Belgium. Ben Bridwell explained the recording process of Mirage Rock, ""Everything was different. We've played live to tape on albums before but not to the degree of it being so dire that every member had to really hone their part for the sake of the take."" 
In late August 2012, a music video for ""Knock Knock"" was released on the internet. Directed by Jared Eberhardt, the video simulates old fashioned nature documentaries and features members of the band being captured, like animals, to be studied. Bridwell revealed that the footage was taken in the Salt Lake City area, ""It seems fitting that we'd finally get to shoot a video around Salt Lake City, as we've got a song that pays tribute to the area called 'The Great Salt Lake' from our first album. Better late than never."" 

Acoustic at the Ryman (2014):
On February 24, 2014, Band of Horses released a ten track live album, Acoustic at the Ryman, featuring stripped down versions of some of their best known songs. The album was recorded over two nights in April 2013 at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville. The band played a 13-date run of acoustic performances across the US, which commenced on 11 February at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre and concluded on 5 March at The Ryman itself. 
In mid-2015 Ben Bridwell and Sam Beam of Iron and Wine will release a covers album titled Sing into My Mouth. The new Band of Horses album is due for release later in 2015 and will be produced by Jason Lytle from the band Granddaddy. The band, along with Lytle, released a Christmas single, ""Hang an Ornament"" in December 2014.]",0.358887330673,0.713456,"[indie pop, indie folk, stomp and holler, indie rock, chamber pop, folk-pop]",0.617639,0.0142337992968,0.315862173854,0.411396217403,0.768953533856,7.31109575006e-08,0.0,0.0927896072459,0.916288615252,0.0,0.0421859508337,0.778920128689,4.0,0.111795655392,1

Background  Kenny Young, Founder and Trustee of APE, explains how the project emerged: ""The project was sparked off by the devastating 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. The idea came in to do a project with The Buena Vista Social Club to fuse their Latin sounds with Western artists and their familiar popular songs. The project evolved when more environmental disasters struck -- the Asian Earthquakes and Hurricane Katrina. But the big picture was climate change. You can call these natural disasters but after all the research and scientific data, we know that we're at least partly to blame for some of these disasters. Global warming is now in the news daily. If we don't act in the time frame our experts give us, our grandchildren will curse us eternally.""  Thom Yorke comments, ""We need a law, we need to have the Government put climate change in its place. If you leave industry to sort it out on a voluntary basis that's never going to happen. So everybody, if they've got any concerns about climate, change has to register that concern with their Government officials because it's the only way to go.""[1]  Charity  Album proceeds will benefit the environmental nonprofit organization Artists' Project Earth (APE), which raises funds for disaster relief efforts and climate change awareness. The artists on this album fully support the record as a show of commitment to the music and to the cause that it endorses.  Music  The main recording sessions took place in Havana at Abdala Studios from April 2005 to June 2006. While the majority of the vocals remain the same, the musicans of the Buena Vista Social Club took the original orchestration from each song and created something utterly unique, casting their trademark mastery over each track. ""Rhythms Del Mundo"" includes reworked tracks such as ""Clocks"" by Coldplay, ""Better Together"" by Jack Johnson, ""She Will be Loved"" by Maroon 5, ""High and Dry"" by Radiohead and ""Dancing Shoes"" by Arctic Monkeys.  ""Rhythms Del Mundo"" also includes music by famed Cuban singers Omara Portuondo and the last vocal recording of Afro-Cuban bolero singer, Ibrahim Ferrer, who passed away in 2005. The other Cuban musicians from The Buena Vista Social Club who perform on this album are as follows: Barbarito Torres, Amandito Valdes, Virgilio Valdes, Angel Terri Domech, Manuel 'Guajiro' Mirabal, Orlando Lopez 'Cachaito' and Demetrio Muniz.

Background:
Kenny Young, Founder and Trustee of APE, explains how the project emerged: ""The project was sparked off by the devastating 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami. The idea came in to do a project with The Buena Vista Social Club to fuse their Latin sounds with Western artists and their familiar popular songs. The project evolved when more environmental disasters struck--the Asian Earthquakes and Hurricane Katrina. But the big picture was climate change. You can call these natural disasters but after all the research and scientific data, we know that we're at least partly to blame for some of these disasters. Global warming is now in the news daily. If we don't act in the time frame our experts give us, our grandchildren will curse us eternally."" 
Thom Yorke comments, ""We need a law, we need to have the Government put climate change in its place. If you leave industry to sort it out on a voluntary basis that's never going to happen. So everybody, if they've got any concerns about climate change, has to register that concern with their Government officials because it's the only way to go."" 

Charity:
Album proceeds benefits the environmental nonprofit organization Artists Project Earth, which raises awareness and funds for climate change projects and for disaster relief efforts . The artists on this album fully support the record as a commitment to the music and to the cause that it endorses. 

Music:
The main recording sessions took place in Havana at Abdala Studios from April 2005 to June 2006 and mixed at Lazy Moon Studios (UK). While the majority of the vocals remain the same, the musicians of the Buena Vista Social Club reworked the original orchestration from each song and created something utterly unique, casting their trademark mastery over each track. Rhythms Del Mundo includes restructured tracks such as ""Clocks"" by Coldplay, ""Better Together"" by Jack Johnson, ""She Will Be Loved"" by Maroon 5, ""High and Dry"" by Radiohead, ""Dancing Shoes"" by Arctic Monkeys and ""Modern Way"" by Kaiser Chiefs, as well as other popular songs. 
Rhythms Del Mundo also includes music by famed Cuban singers Omara Portuondo and the last vocal recording of Afro-Cuban bolero singer, Ibrahim Ferrer, who died in 2005. The other Cuban musicians from The Buena Vista Social Club who perform on this album are as follows: Barbarito Torres, Amadito Valdés, Virgilio Valdes, Angel Terri Domech, Manuel ""Guajiro"" Mirabal, Orlando Lopez 'Cachaito' and Demetrio Muniz. This project is the brainchild and concept of Kenny Young and the Berman Brothers. They produced the 16 new original recordings on the CD.

In Summer 2008, the first follow-up album, Rhythms del Mundo - Cubano Alemán was released in Germany, with some popular German artists recording Cuban remakes of their songs in Cuba and other artists sending their songs to Cuba, waiting for a Cuban remake to rerecord the voice over the now Latin music recorded in Cuba by Cuban artists. The CD was a charity project for a climate protection project, ""Artists' Project Earth"". 
In July 2009, the second follow-up album Rhythms del Mundo Classics was released, featuring artists like The Killers, Amy Winehouse, Keane, Jack Johnson, The Rolling Stones, KT Tunstall and others.

Their debut album Sigh No More was released on Gentlemen of the Road/Island Records on the 5th October 2009, and the first single ""Little Lion Man"" came out a week earlier.  Several months after the release of Little Lion Man, it was  voted #1 by listeners in the Australian Youth Radio station Triple J's Hottest 100 for 2009. They played live in the Triple J studio on the countdown day to celebrate the result. In the summer of 2010, ""Little Lion Man"" peaked at #1 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart and #45 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States. ""The Cave"" peaked at #3 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart and #27 on the Billboard Hot 100. Both singles have gone Platinum in the United States.  Mumford & Sons was ranked as one of VH1's ""You Oughta Know"" artists of 2010.  For the 2011 Grammys, the group were nominated for Best New Artist and Best Rock Song (for ""Little Lion Man""), losing both awards, although a performance of ""The Cave""  at the ceremony gave the group major publicity.

In Sept 2012, the band released their second studio album ""Babel"" to critical acclaim. It debuted at number one in the US and UK, becoming the fastest selling album of 2012 in the UK and the second-biggest selling debut in 2012 in the US. The album won Album of the Year at the 2013 Grammys. After the huge success of ""Babel"" and the subsequent tour, Ben Lovett told Rolling Stone ""there won't be any Mumford & Sons' activities for the foreseeable future...we're going to take a considerable amount of time off and just go back to hanging out and having no commitments or pressure or anything like that.""  In Oct 2014, rumors started to circulate that the band were in the studio with producer James Ford, though it remains unclear whether a new third album is in the works.  http://www.myspace.com/mumfordandsons http://www.mumfordandsons.com/, “We wanted to do something unashamed,” says Ben Lovett. “We’re ..., Inspired by folk, rock, country, and bluegrass, the London-based, platinum-selling ..., Since they formed in December 2007, the members of Mumford ..., Mumford & Sons are a British rock band from London, England, formed in 2007.

The band have won a number of music awards throughout their career, with Sigh No More earning the band the Brit Award for Best British Album in 2011 and six overall Grammy Award nominations.

The band received eight total Grammy nominations for Babel and won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. The band also won the Brit Award for Best British Group in 2013. 

History:

Early years (2007-2009):
Mumford & Sons were formed in December 2007 by multi-instrumentalists Marcus Mumford, Ben Lovett, Winston Marshall and Ted Dwane. Band members play guitar, drums, keyboard instruments, bass guitar, and traditional folk instruments such as banjo, mandolin and resonator guitar. The band name originates from the fact that Marcus Mumford was the most visible member, organizing the band and their performances. Lovett indicated that the name was meant to invoke the sense of an ""antiquated family business name"". 
A handful of similar bands were increasing their visibility in West London around the same time, giving rise to the label ""West London folk scene"". Mumford downplays that characterisation as an exaggeration--Mumford & Sons and a few other folk acts just happened to be operating in the same general area at the time. In an interview with the Herald Sun, Marcus Mumford said, ""It's not folk really. Well, some of it is, and it's certainly not a scene. Someone got over-excited about a few bands who live in a hundred-mile radius and put it in a box to sell it as a package. It's a community, not a scene. It's not exclusive."" Having developed in the same musical and cultural environment, Mumford & Sons' sound has been compared to that of artists such as Noah and the Whale, Johnny Flynn and Laura Marling, whose backing band had included Marshall, Mumford, and Dwane. 
In early 2008 the band began working with manager Adam Tudhope, who, as part of management company Everybody's, also represents Keane and Laura Marling. It was through Tudhope's connection that Mumford & Sons were exposed to their future A&R at Island, Louis Bloom, who began monitoring the band. Bloom told HitQuarters that they were still at a fledgling state and not yet ready for a label deal: ""There was no one there for it, just a few friends, and they needed time to develop. Over the next six months I kept going to see them and they were literally picking up fans every time."" 
In February 2008, the band completed an extensive UK tour with support from Alessi's Ark, Sons of Noel and Adrian, Peggy Sue and others. June 2008 marked the band's first appearance at the Glastonbury Festival. They also toured Australia with Laura Marling, whose disinclination to interact with audiences encouraged Mumford into the spotlight. The experience helped inform his attitude towards Mumford & Sons audiences, which is to interact frequently and to try to create a comfortable, casual atmosphere. Mumford & Sons' first project was an EP entitled Love Your Ground which took a year to complete and was released in November 2008 on Chess Club Records. 

Sigh No More (2009-2012):
Throughout 2008 and into 2009, Mumford & Sons performed in small to moderate venues in the UK and US, exposing audiences to Love Your Ground tracks and other material that would eventually become Sigh No More. The band finally recorded Sigh No More with Markus Dravs, who had produced albums with artists such as Arcade Fire. At the time, band members did not even own their own instruments--Dravs initially turned them away when they showed up at the recording sessions empty-handed. The only track from Love Your Ground to be included on Sigh No More was ""Little Lion Man"". The band told the Herald Sun that they self-financed the album to avoid the artistic and technical compromises that sometimes befall studio-financed projects. They toured again in support of Laura Marling in 2009, and Mumford & Sons were contributing musicians to her 2010 album I Speak Because I Can. 

In August 2009, Mumford & Sons signed a licensing deal to Island Records in the UK, to Dew Process in Australia and New Zealand, to Glassnote Records in North America and Cooperative Music in the rest of the world, and through its own label Gentlemen of the Road. Dew Process boss Paul Piticco signed the band after witnessing a US performance in 2009 and appreciating their ""honest"" approach and unique sound. Their debut album was released on 5 October 2009 with ""Little Lion Man"" as the lead single. 
Dave Berry of XFM named ""Little Lion Man"" his record of the week, and in another interview with the band, Berry said ""Screw 'of the week', it's my favourite track of the year."" BBC Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe made ""Little Lion Man"" his ""Reaction Record"" on 27 July 2009, before naming it the ""Hottest Record in the World"" the following evening. 
In their first performance on US network television, the band played ""Little Lion Man"" on CBS's Late Show with David Letterman on 17 February 2010. This appearance was followed by a performance of ""The Cave"" on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson on 26 February 2010. Mumford & Sons have been commercially successful in Australia and New Zealand. By January 2010 ""Little Lion Man"" topped the Triple J Hottest 100 list for all of 2009, with its margin of victory the largest in the history of the chart. In November 2010, the band won an ARIA Music Award for Most Popular International Artist.Sigh No More first reached number 9 on the New Zealand charts in October 2010, and subsequently topped the chart in January 2011 due to the popularity of the singles from the album. 
In a March 2010 interview, Ray Davies announced that Mumford & Sons will be appearing on his forthcoming collaborations album. Marcus Mumford confirmed this in an interview the same month, stating, ""I am more excited about that than I have been about anything before in my life"". Mumford & Sons performed the track ""Days/This Time Tomorrow"" along with Davies on 12 February 2010 on Later... with Jools Holland. 

In December 2010, Mumford & Sons earned Grammy Award nominations for Best New Artist and Best Rock Song (""Little Lion Man""). While they did not go on to win an award, the band performed their single ""The Cave"" at the Grammy ceremony. The performance earned positive media attention and boosted visibility for Sigh No More--US sales increased by 99% in the period following the ceremony in February 2011. The album subsequently peaked at number two on the UK Albums Chart and the Billboard 200 in the US. 
On 7 December 2010, in collaboration with Dharohar Project and Laura Marling, Mumford & Sons released an EP album recorded in Delhi, India. The album was recorded in a makeshift studio with traditional Rajasthani musicians and features four collaborations, including multicultural mash-ups of Marling's ""Devil's Spoke"" and Mumford & Sons' ""To Darkness."" Sigh No More is certified 2x Platinum in the US and 4x Platinum in the UK. 
The band continued to grow in popularity in 2011, winning several major awards and headlining larger shows and festivals. In February 2011, they received a European Border Breakers Award for their international success. They received a Brit Award for British Album of the Year with Sigh No More and performed ""Timshel"" at the ceremony. UK sales of the album subsequently increased by 266 percent. While touring the United States in early 2011, the band began writing songs for the follow-up album. Keyboardist Ben Lovett credited the creative atmosphere of Nashville, Tennessee with easing the songwriting process. While performing in Kansas City, Missouri on 3 June, the first stop of their US tour, the band announced they had been recording a new album, initially set to be released in late 2011. They then performed several new tracks from the forthcoming album, the title of which was not revealed. 
In April 2011 the group joined Old Crow Medicine Show and Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros on the inaugural Railroad Revival Tour, which was inspired by the Festival Express tour across Canada in 1970 that included Buddy Guy, Janis Joplin, The Grateful Dead and The Band. Travelling exclusively in vintage rail cars, the three bands performed in six ""unique outdoor locations"" over the course of a week starting in Oakland, California. Ketch Secor of Old Crow told American Songwriter that ""It's like we left all our baggage at home and just brought our instruments,"" often writing new songs while on the train. ""We were just on these old rattling rails. It was a railroad odyssey that would have made Woody and Doc tip their hats and blow their whistles,"" he says. They appear in the musical documentary Big Easy Express, directed by Emmett Malloy, being made of the trip which premiered March 2012 at the South by Southwest Film Conference and Festival (SXSW Film) in Austin, Texas--winning the Headliner Audience Award. The film went on to win ""Best Long Form Video"" at the 2013 Grammy Awards. 
Mumford & Sons played at the Glastonbury Festival on Friday 24 June 2011, and then embarked on a North American tour on which they frequently performed songs from the upcoming album. They recorded two songs for Andrea Arnold's adaptation of Wuthering Heights, one of which (entitled ""Enemy"") is featured during the closing credits. In June 2012, Mumford & Sons contributed the song ""Learn Me Right"" with Birdy to the Pixar film Brave, which came to be called ""Not with Haste"". 

Babel (2012-2013):
On 16 July 2012, Mumford & Sons officially announced the details of their second studio album Babel, including the release date of 24 September 2012 and a track listing of 12 songs. A deluxe edition containing three exclusive songs was also announced. A week later, the album became available for pre-order. The lead single ""I Will Wait"" premiered on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show on 7 August. On 29 August 2012, Mumford & Sons recorded their concert at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado. The Concert was later released on DVD, Vinyl and on iTunes as ""Road to Red Rocks"". The performance of ""I Will Wait"" from the concert was released ahead of the DVD on 9 September as the band's official video for the song. On 22 September 2012, the band performed two songs from the new album, ""I Will Wait"" and ""Below My Feet"", on Saturday Night Live. 
Babel debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and the US Billboard 200. It became the fastest selling album of 2012 in the UK, selling over 158,000 copies in its first week, and was the biggest selling debut of any album in 2012 in the US, selling 600,000 in its first week, and over a million worldwide. 
In December 2012, Winston Marshall told NME that the band was rehearsing and writing for their next album. 
The first phase of a 2013 world tour in support of Babel was released in November 2012. Their Gentlemen of the Road tour continued through 2013. After performing two shows on 8 & 9 June 2013 at the Austin360 Amphitheater in Austin, Texas, United States, bassist Ted Dwane checked into a hospital the next day. Surgeons found a blood clot on the surface of his brain and performed surgery to remove it. Heeding medical advice to aid Dwane's recovery, the band cancelled the rest of its Summer Stampede Tour, including performances at the 2013 Bonnaroo Music Festival and returned to the UK. Dwane's surgery was successful, and his recovery was such that the band managed to headline Glastonbury Festival. 
After first including select stopover cities in their 2012 Tour, the band again selected five cities in Canada, the UK and US to host a two-day festival with shows on multiple stages as well as various other activities and performances. The first stopover of the 2013 Gentleman of the Road tour was in Lewes,from 19 to 20 July. Next was Simcoe, Ontario from 23 to 24 August, followed by Troy, Ohio from 30 to 31 August. The band rounded out their tour with stopovers in Guthrie, Oklahoma on 6 and 7 September and finally St. Augustine, Florida on 13 and 14 September. The Vaccines, Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros, Vampire Weekend, Old Crow Medicine Show, Yacht Club DJs, Alabama Shakes and various other bands also performed at many of the stopovers throughout the tour. 
On 20 September 2013, they announced they were going on hiatus for a ""considerable amount of time."". ""There won't be any Mumford & Sons activities for the foreseeable future following Friday's show,"" said Ben Lovett, the keyboardist, in an interview with Rolling Stone. 
In December 2013, the band's bassist, Ted Dwane, stated that the band would be meeting to write new music in February 2014. Then on 20 July 2014, Ben Lovett confirmed that they are currently recording their third studio album in London. 

Wilder Mind (2015-present):
Mumford & Sons confirmed their return on 14 January 2015 with the announcement of a headline performance at the 2015 Bonnaroo Music Festival. On 2 February 2015 it was confirmed that Mumford and Sons would headline Reading & Leeds Festivals 2015. A new website and logo were released alongside the announcement. In the following weeks, many other dates were added to their 2015 worldwide festival tour. 
On 27 February 2015, the band released a short video teasing new live material, promising a further announcement on 2 March 2015 . It was revealed on 2 March 2015 that the third studio album from the band will be entitled Wilder Mind and will be released on 4 May 2015, with the first single ""Believe"" being released to radio stations on 9 March and available to download straight after. The announcement also confirmed a new series of Gentleman of the Road Stopovers festivals for Summer 2015. 
Mumford & Sons made their live return at the 375 capacity Oslo, Hackney on 8 March 2015 with an intimate show for family and friends. The band played again to fans on the following two nights, debuting songs from Wilder Mind. This was followed by shows at small venues in Berlin, Los Angeles, Toronto and New York, with the band playing two nights in each city. The second single from Wilder Mind, ""The Wolf"" premiered on BBC Radio 1 on 9 April 2015, and was made available to download straight after, with the official audio being uploaded to the band's YouTube channel. The official video, a live video of the band performing the song, was uploaded to YouTube on 13 April 2015. 
On 11 April 2015, the band performed on Saturday Night Live for the second time. They performed ""The Wolf"" and ""Believe"" for the first time on television. Two days later on 13 April 2015, the band announced an extensive US tour in-between summer festival dates; the tour starts on 2 June 2015 in Brooklyn, NY. 
For Record Store Day on 18 April 2015, the band released the coordinates of stores where fans could attend to listen to Wilder Mind in full on vinyl record, over two weeks before its release. The band also released a limited edition 7"" record of ""Believe""/""The Wolf"" for the event. The band unveiled a rebranded website on 20 April 2015, along with a new forum for fans to discuss topics related to the band. A day later on 21 April 2015, the band appeared as a musical guest on Later... with Jools Holland, performing ""The Wolf"" and ""Believe"". On the extended version, the band also premiered ""Snake Eyes"" for the first time on television. A snippet of the studio version of the song had already been heard on the 12 April 2015 edition of Sky Sports Super Sunday, and a live video released to YouTube on 20 April 2015. 
On 30 April 2015 the band announced an intimate show at Brighton Corn Exchange exclusively to members of their mailing list. The gig took place on 1 May 2015, with the band playing songs from all three albums. On 27 April 2015, the band were invited to perform a Live Lounge special for BBC Radio 1 at Maida Vale Studios. As well as ""The Cave"" and a cover of Shaura's ""2Shy"", four songs from Wilder Mind were performed, including a premiere of ""Hot Gates"", which became available to download straight after. Two days later on 29 April 2015, the band performed ""The Wolf"" on The Graham Norton Show. 
Wilder Mind was released 4 May 2015. On May 5 May 2015, the band recorded ""Believe"" for the Late Show with David Letterman before performing a full set of songs for live-streamed webcast Legends of Letterman. The band continued this US promo with an appearance on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart on 7 May 2015 and live streamed concerts for iHeartRadio and SiriusXM on 8 and 9 May 2015 respectively.Wilder Mind debuted at number 1 on the UK Albums Chart and US Billboard 200 in its first week of release. 

Musical style and development:

The band began by using bluegrass and folk instrumentation, with the core instruments of acoustic guitar, banjo, piano and a double bass, played with a rhythmic style based in alternative rock and folk. In the documentary Big Easy Express, Marcus Mumford recognises the Old Crow Medicine Show influence: ""I first heard Old Crow's music when I was, like, 16, 17, and that really got me into, like, folk music, bluegrass. I mean, I'd listened to a lot of Dylan, but I hadn't really ventured into the country world so much. So Old Crow were the band that made me fall in love with country music."" Mumford acknowledges that ""the band inspired them to pick up the banjo and start their now famous country nights in London."" Ketch Secor, Old Crow front-man, concurs: ""Those boys took the message and ran with it."" 

Emmylou Harris was ""among the gateway artists who helped Mumford and bandmates Ben Lovett, Ted Dwane and Winston Marshall discover their love for American roots music. It started with the 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' soundtrack ... That eventually led them to the Old Crow Medicine Show and then deep immersion in old-timey sounds from America's long-neglected past."" 

Much of Mumford & Sons' lyrical content has a strong literary influence, its debut album name deriving from William Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing. The track ""Sigh No More"" includes lines from the play such as Serve God love me and mend, For man is a giddy thing, and One foot in sea and one on shore. The title of the song ""Roll Away Your Stone"" is an allusion to Macbeth; the song includes the line Stars hide your fires/ And these here are my desires which borrows and pares down Macbeth's line in act 1, scene 4: Stars, hide your fires,/ Let not light see my black and deep desires. Additionally, ""The Cave"" includes several references to The Odyssey, in particular the sirens that Odysseus encounters on his journey home. The song also contains many references to G.K. Chesterton's book, St. Francis of Assisi, in which Chesterton uses Plato's Cave as a way of explaining how St. Francis views the world from God's perspective. ""Little Lion Man"" appears to be a retelling in dramatic monologue form of Chretien de Troyes' Yvain, the Knight of the Lion, which is the story of a knight who goes mad after betraying a promise to his wife to return to her. Both ""Timshel"" and ""Dust Bowl Dance"" draw heavily from the John Steinbeck novels Of Mice and Men, East of Eden and The Grapes of Wrath. 
The band's change in sound on their third album was described by Lovett as a ""natural departure"". At the end of the Babel tour Winston Marshall traded his banjo for electric guitar in sound checks and Mumford started playing more drums as the band jammed on heavy instrumentals and even some Radiohead tunes. Banjo does not feature on the record, an instrument that had become synonymous with the band. NME reported that the band's sound is ""More expansive than ever and decidedly heavier, thanks to the shift in instrumentation."" The group also employed a full drumkit instead of kick drum. ""We've had our standard line-up of instruments for the last six years and we felt like that was our palette, but we started picking up other stuff,"" said Lovett. ""It's a very natural departure from some of that rootsier stuff."" 
Lovett told NME that working with James Ford for Wilder Mind was part of trying something new. ""We felt a need for change. Not from Markus Dravs, but he was so closely attached to those first two records that as we had taken that time off, we wanted to try doing something new. It felt like, if we do our third record with Markus, does that mean we do our ninth and 10th records with Markus? At some point you have to try different things, as we collectively felt like it was time to try other stuff. Markus knows that we might well make the next record with him. We definitely haven't broken up with Dravs, we're just playing the field!"" 

Gentlemen of the Road:
In 2009 the band founded Gentlemen of the Road, a live promotions company, record label and organiser of the global series of Stopover Festivals.

The band consists of Jim James (vocals, guitar), Carl Broemel (guitar), ""Two Tone"" Tommy Blankenship (bass), Bo Koster (keyboards) and Patrick Hallahan (drums). The band is best known for their reverb-soaked sound and their enthusiastic live shows. My Morning Jacket is signed with ATO Records. The band's style is a blend of alternative, alt country, folk rock and psychedelic rock.  The band's moniker comes from a discarded coat James saw while walking through the remains of his favorite bar the morning after it burned down. The coat had the letters ""MMJ"" embroided on it. The band has released six albums so far:  ""The Tennessee Fire"" (1999), ""At Dawn"" (2001), ""It Still Moves"" (2003), ""Z"" (2005), ""Evil Urges"" (2008) and ""Circuital"" (2011). The band's breakthrough came when their 2003 single ""One Big Holiday"" became one of the most played songs on college radio that year.  2008's ""I'm Amazed"" was also a sizable hit, peaking at #6 on Billboard's Triple A (adult album alternative) Singles chart.   The Circuital songfacts reports that ""Circuital"" was recorded inside a church's converted gymnasium in the band's hometown of Louisville, Kentucky. Said frontman Jim James: ""I hate the phrase 'going back to our roots', but for this record we came home and made it in Kentucky. And it just felt a lot like it did when we were first starting out.""  James co-produced the record with Tucker Martine. The pair first worked together when James appeared on Laura Veirs ' album ""July Flame"" in 2010, which Martine, Veirs' husband, also produced.

History:

My Morning Jacket was formed in 1998 in Louisville, Kentucky by singer, songwriter and guitarist Jim James (real name: James Olliges Jr). The original line-up also included three members of the Shelbyville emo-punk band Winter Death Club; namely John McQuade (later known as Johnny Quaid - guitar and vocals), Tom Blankenship (later known as Two Tone Tommy - bass) and J. Roberts (later known as J. Glenn - drums). Winter Death Club were signed to Charleston indie label Street Records in 1997 by Tas Taiganides after he booked them and Jim James (performing as ""Month of Sundays"") for a ""Punk Rock Matinees"" show at the Horse & Cart Cafe. Winter Death Club released a 7"" split single with Eurogression on Street Records. Jim James was also offered a record deal, but he declined the offer, disbanded Month of Sundays and formed a new band with Quaid, Blankenship and Glenn. The band was named My Morning Jacket and subsequently signed to Darla Records. 
The band's debut album, The Tennessee Fire, was released in May 1999. The following year, keyboardist Danny Cash was added to the line up. A second album, At Dawn, followed. It again featured drummer J. Glenn, but he had already left the band by the time it was released in 2001. Glenn was replaced by Chris 'KC' Guetig, although he was replaced by James' childhood friend Patrick Hallahan in May 2002. 
My Morning Jacket signed with ATO Records in 2002. In 2003, they released It Still Moves, their major-label debut. This was followed by a live EP Acoustic Citsuoca, which was notable for the absence of reverb on Jim James' vocals and thus sounded very different from their earlier works. 
In January 2004, Quaid and Cash left the band and were replaced by Carl Broemel and Bo Koster respectively. In November 2004, the band released two collections of early work, which included demos, live recordings, and cover versions. These discs are entitled Early Recordings Chapter 1 - The Sandworm Cometh and Early Recordings Chapter 2 - Learning. 
October 2005 saw the release of the critically acclaimed album Z, released by Sony BMG. The band was featured (under the name Ruckus) in the 2005 film Elizabethtown. They contributed an original song ""Where to Begin"" and ""Same In Any Language"" written by Nancy Wilson of Heart. 
In 2006, My Morning Jacket were musical guests on the Late Show with David Letterman, performing with members of the Boston Pops, with whom they played two shows at Boston Symphony Hall later in the month. In 2006 the band also released a live double album and DVD entitled Okonokos. 
In 2007, the band opened for Pearl Jam at Lollapalooza in August, and recorded their album Evil Urges, which was released on June 10, 2008. Prior to its release, they performed at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April, and at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in June. It was followed by a June 20 show at Radio City Music Hall. 

Their 2008 Bonnaroo set lasted almost four hours, starting at midnight on Friday; it featured guest appearances by Kirk Hammett of Metallica, comedian Zach Galifianakis and the Nashville-Louisville horns. Unfazed by a torrential downpour for much of its first half, the band's set went on to feature thirty five songs, including all but two tracks from Evil Urges and several covers, such as Erykah Badu's ""Tyrone"", Kool and the Gang's ""Get Down on It"", Sly and the Family Stone's ""Hot Fun in the Summertime"", James Brown's ""Cold Sweat"", Bobby Womack's ""Across 110th Street"", Funkadelic's ""Hit It and Quit It"", Velvet Underground's ""Oh! Sweet Nuthin"" and Mötley Crüe's ""Home Sweet Home"". 
On May 10, 2008, they were the musical guest on Saturday Night Live and played ""Evil Urges"" and ""I'm Amazed"". In August 2008, an animated music video for the song ""Touch Me I'm Going to Scream Part 2"" was released. The video was created by the graphics design team Hornet's Mixtape Club. The Autumn 2008 European Tour had to be canceled after Jim James was injured in a fall from the stage in Iowa City, Iowa. Evil Urges was nominated for a Grammy for Best Alternative rock Album 
The band was featured on CNN's 2009 New Year's Eve show with Anderson Cooper and Kathy Griffin, performing from Madison Square Garden. The band supported Neil Young on his Australian tour and played the Big Day Out festival. Celebración de la Ciudad Natal, released on Record Store Day, April 18, 2009, is an eight song EP taken from two live recordings, notably the band's Summer 2008 Waterfront Park concert in their hometown of Louisville, KY. In May 2009 Open Salon rock critic MJ Wycha called My Morning Jacket ""the best thing to happen to rock music in years."" 
The entire band appeared as themselves in the American Dad episode, ""My Morning Straitjacket"", which aired on November 22, 2009. The episode featured the single Touch Me I'm Going To Scream Part 2 in a psychedelic music video experienced by Stan Smith. Stan then enjoys I'm Amazed and changes his doorbell to an excerpt of Phone Went West. Remnants plays as Francine gets Stan backstage to meet Jim James in person. The episode ends with a live performance of Wordless Chorus. 
At one point, there were plans for My Morning Jacket to tour as The Electric Mayhem, the fictional band from the puppet series The Muppet Show. The band would have performed live backstage, while animatronic versions of the puppet characters appeared on stage. However, The Walt Disney Company, who own the rights to The Muppets, abandoned this project. 
In 2010, My Morning Jacket took up residency at New York's Terminal 5 on October 18, 19, 21, 22 and 23, performing one of their five studio releases each night along with additional material from the relevant period. According to the September 16, 2010 issue of Rolling Stone, My Morning Jacket has started working on their next LP. ""We've got five songs done,"" says front man Jim James. ""It'll probably be out next spring."" James is co-producing the record with The Decemberists collaborator Tucker Martine in an old church in My Morning Jacket's hometown of Louisville, Kentucky. ""We're trying to do everything but the strings live,"" says James. ""There's something old and dirty-sounding about it."" Their sixth album Circuital was released on May 31, 2011. On October 12, 2010, My Morning Jacket performed on Late Show with David Letterman. The performance was webcast live on CBS.com. The band also played Late Night with Jimmy Fallon along with The Roots on October 13, 2010. They also appeared on VH1's Storytellers on June 3, 2011. 
In 2013 it was announced that the band would be hosting and performing at their own One Big Holiday all-inclusive music festival at the Hard Rock Hotel Rivera Maya in Puerto Aventuras, Mexico. Along with the band, The Flaming Lips, The Preservation Hall Jazz Band and Mariachi El Bronx would round out the four night event that took place January 26-30, 2014. In 2015 the second One Big Holiday festival took place at the same resort between January 31-February 4. The second festival featured Band of Horses, Dr. Dog, The War on Drugs, Dawes, Sylvan Esso and Biz Markie. 
In early 2015, it was announced that the band would headline the Boston Calling Music Festival in May 2015. On March 3, 2015 the band's seventh album The Waterfall was announced, with a release date set for May 5, 2015. The first song available from this release is called Big Decisions.

Wilco's lineup has changed frequently, with only singer Jeff Tweedy and bassist John Stirratt remaining from the original incarnation. The other current members are guitarist Nels Cline, multi-instrumentalists Pat Sansone and Mikael Jorgensen, and drummer Glenn Kotche. Wilco has released e⃥i⃥g⃥h⃥t⃥ nine studio albums, a live double album, and three collaborations: two with Billy Bragg, and one with The Minus 5.  Wilco's music has been inspired by a wide variety of artists and styles, including Bill Fay and Television, and has in turn influenced music by The National and Cherry Ghost. The band continued in the alternative country of Uncle Tupelo on its debut album A.M. (1995), but has since introduced more experimental aspects to their music.  Wilco garnered media attention for its fourth album, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot (2002), and the controversy surrounding it. After the recording sessions were complete, reprise records rejected the album and dismissed Wilco from the label. As part of a buy-out deal, Reprise gave Wilco the rights to the album for free. After streaming Foxtrot on its website, Wilco sold the album to Nonesuch Records in 2002. Both record labels are subsidiaries of Warner Music Group, leading one critic to say that the album showed ""how screwed up the music business [was] in the early twenty-first century."" Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is Wilco's most successful release to date, selling over 590,000 copies. Wilco won two Grammy Awards for their fifth studio album, 2004's A Ghost is Born, including Best Alternative Music Album.  The I Might Songfacts reports that Wilco's eighth album, The Whole Love (2011), marked the first ever release on the band's own label dBpm.  Formation  Wilco was formed following the breakup of the influential alternative country music group Uncle Tupelo. Singer Jay Farrar quit the band in 1994 supposedly because of a soured relationship with co-singer Jeff Tweedy. Both Tweedy and Farrar sought to form bands immediately after the breakup. Tweedy was able to keep the entire Uncle Tupelo lineup sans Farrar, including bassist John Stirratt, drummer Ken Coomer, and multi-instrumentalist Max Johnston. The band was tempted to keep the Uncle Tupelo name, but ultimately decided to rename the band. The group named itself ""Wilco"" after the CB radio voice procedure for ""I Will Comply"". [N.B. this term originates in World War 2 Battle of Britain Fighter pilot slang for will co-operate, if not earlier in the Royal Air Force]  A.M. and Being There  After collaborating with Syd Straw on a cover version of the Ernest Tubb song, ""The T.b. Is Whipping Me"" (released in September 1994 on the Red Hot + Country compilation), Wilco began recording tracks for A.M., their first studio album, at Easley studio in June 1995. A demo tape from these recordings was sent to executives at reprise records, a subsidiary of Warner Brothers, and the label signed Tweedy to a contract. Although Tweedy stated that he wanted a more collaborative project than Uncle Tupelo, only his name appeared on the Reprise contract. Tweedy requested songwriting submissions from other members, but only one submission--John Stirratt's ""It's Just That Simple""--appeared on A.M.. It was the last song Wilco ever released that was solely written by a member besides Tweedy.  Stylistically similar to Uncle Tupelo, the music on A.M. was considered to be straightforward alternative country rock in what Tweedy later described as ""trying to tread some water with a perceived audience."" A.M. peaked at number twenty-seven on the Billboard Heatseekers chart, considerably lower than the debut album of Jay Farrar's new band, Son Volt. The album was met with modest reviews though it would rank thirty-fourth in the Village Voice's 1995 Pazz & Jop critics poll. Critically and commercially paling in comparison to the reception of Son Volt's album, the Wilco members perceived A.M. to be a failure. Shortly after the release of the album, multi-instrumentalist Jay Bennett joined the band, providing the band with a keyboardist and another guitarist.  Wilco made its live debut on November 17, 1994 to a capacity crowd at Cicero's Basement Bar in St. Louis, Missouri (the band was billed for the occasion as ""Black Shampoo"").  During the two hundred-date tour supporting A.M., Tweedy began to write songs for a second album. The lyrical theme of the songs reflected a relationship between musical artist and a listener; Tweedy chose this topic because he sought to eschew the alternative country fan base. Ken Coomer elaborated: ""The whole No Depression thing was funny to us because people seemed to forget that Jeff was a bigger punk-rock fan than a country fan. It led to things like us all switching instruments on 'Misunderstood,' where I'm playing guitar."" A number of songs were recorded with this theme, including ""Sunken Treasure"" and ""Hotel Arizona"", however, Wilco also recorded a number of songs in the style of A.M. Wilco named the album Being There after a Peter Sellers film of the same name. The band went through some personnel changes during the recording sessions. Max Johnston left the band because he felt that his role in the band had diminished in favor of Bennett; he had also been replaced by violinist Jesse Greene on one track because the band felt that Johnston was unable to play the part. Bob Egan of Freakwater briefly joined the band in the studio, playing pedal steel guitar on ""Far, Far Away"" and ""Dreamer in My Dreams"", and then became an official member in September 1996.  Unlike the A.M. recording sessions, the band had no vocation for producing a hit song from their second effort. The recording sessions produced nineteen songs, too many for a single album release. Tweedy was concerned about the high retail price that a double album would be sold for (at least $30), so he asked reprise records to release it as a double album at a single album price ($17.98 or less). Reprise agreed to this on the terms that they received Wilco's share of the album royalties. It was estimated in 2003 that the band lost almost $600,000 on the deal, but Tweedy was satisfied. Being There was well-received by critics from several major media outlets, including Rolling Stone. The album reached #73 on the Billboard album charts, a significant improvement from A.M., and placed fourteenth on the Pazz & Jop Critics Poll for 1996.  Summerteeth and the Mermaid Avenue sessions  In November 1997, Wilco entered Willie Nelson's recording studio in Spicewood, Texas to record a third studio album. The album was lyrically inspired by the marital problems of Tweedy and his wife, as well as by twentieth-century literature. Tweedy relied heavily on Bennett to provide music for the singer's ""bold, but depressing"" lyrics. Wilco recorded several songs, including ""Via Chicago"" and ""She's A Jar,"" but began working on another project before assembling the tracks into an album.  Nora Guthrie contacted singer-songwriter Billy Bragg in spring 1995 about recording some unreleased songs by her father, folk singer Woody Guthrie. Most of the songs were written late in Guthrie's life when he was unable to record due to the motor impairments of Huntington's disease. By the 1990s, Woody Guthrie had become a ""relic"" to the MTV generation, and Nora sought to establish a different legacy for the musician. To Nora, Bragg was ""the only singer I knew taking on the same issues as Woody."" Bragg was concerned, however, that his fans would not realize that the songs were written by Guthrie when he performed them on tour, so he decided to record the album with another band.  Bragg contacted Tweedy and Bennett about co-recording the album while Wilco was on the European segment of their Being There tour. Bragg was particularly fond of Being There because their influences extended farther back than the 1950s. Although Tweedy was indifferent to the offer, Bennett was enthused about recording songs of one of his idols--Bennett's previous band Titanic Love Affair was named after a Billy Bragg lyric. A recording contract between Bragg and Wilco was signed after a show at Shepherd's Bush Empire. Bragg mostly recorded the politically-charged lyrics, while Tweedy preferred to record lyrics that showcased Guthrie as a ""freak weirdo."" The recording of Mermaid Avenue began on December 12, 1997, and was the topic of BBC's Man in the Sand documentary film.  Tempers flared between Bragg and Wilco after the album was completed. Bennett believed that Bragg was overproducing his songs, a sharp contrast to Wilco's sparser contributions. Bennett called Bragg about the possibility of remixing Bragg's songs, to which Bragg responded with ""you make your record, and I'll make mine, fucker."" Eventually Bragg sent copies of his recordings to Chicago for Bennett to remix, but Bragg refused to use the new mixes on the album. The two parties were unable to establish a promotional tour and quarreled over royalties and guest musician fees.  Despite these conflicts, the album was released on June 23, 1998, and sold over 277,000 copies. The album received rave reviews from Robert Christgau and Rolling Stone, and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album. It also placed fourth on the Pazz & Jop critics poll for 1998. After the album was released, Bob Egan was replaced by multi-instrumentalist Leroy Bach.  After the completion of the Mermaid Avenue sessions, Wilco returned to Spicewood to complete their third studio album, Summerteeth. Unlike previous Wilco and Uncle Tupelo recordings, the album featured a lot of overdubbing with Pro Tools. Stirratt and Coomer were concerned with the production, since it reduced their involvement in the music. According to Stirratt:""The story of Summerteeth is Jay bought a Mellotron and he was going to use it, no matter what. It was lovely, but it was overdone. Once they got going on the overdubs, they didn't stop. And nobody in the band stepped up to stop the madness ... It reminds me of Heart of Darkness, where you knowingly extend the creative process for the purpose of exploration or redemption, or whatever it is you're looking for."" During 1999, Warner Brothers was looking to help repay a $16 billion debt acquired during the recent merger of parent company Warner Communications with Time Inc... As a result, Warner's imprints were under pressure to produce musical acts that would yield hit records. The head of Reprise, Howie Klein, who had previously authorized the release of Being There as a double album, was willing to let Wilco produce Summerteeth without label input. When Klein played the album for Reprise's A&R department, however, they demanded a radio single for the album. Wilco agreed to do this ""once and once only"" and recorded a radio-friendly version of ""Can't Stand It"" at the request of David Kahne, the head of the A&R department. The single version of ""Can't Stand It"" failed to cross over from Triple-A radio to alternative rock stations. Consequently, the album sold only 200,000 copies, significantly less than Being There. This was despite critical acclaim; the album placed eighth on the Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 1999.  After the release of Summerteeth, the band resumed the Mermaid Avenue sessions. Although they had recorded enough material for a second release in 1998, Wilco recorded a few new songs for Mermaid Avenue Vol. II. ""Someday Some Morning Sometime,"" featuring a vibraphone filtered through a space echo, was identified by Tweedy as being the ""piece to the puzzle"" towards the creation of their fourth studio album. The album was released on May 30, 2000, and was the last release from the sessions.  Yankee Hotel Foxtrot  Shortly after the recording sessions for Mermaid Avenue Vol. II, Wilco purchased a studio in Irving Park, Chicago, which they named the Wilco Loft. The band recorded some tracks in the studio in early 2000 for a fourth studio album. In May 2000, Jeff Tweedy requested to perform with Jim O'Rourke at a festival in Chicago; Tweedy was a fan of O'Rourke's Bad Timing. O'Rourke introduced Tweedy to drummer Glenn Kotche, and the trio enjoyed working together so much that they decided to record an album as a side project named Loose Fur. Wilco had recorded an entire album of music at this point, but Tweedy was unhappy with the drum parts. He enjoyed Kotche's contributions to Loose Fur so much that Tweedy brought him into the studio to re-record some demos. Some believe that Tweedy sought to make Wilco sound like Loose Fur after officially replacing Ken Coomer with Kotche in January 2001.  Although Bennett sought to act as both mixer and engineer for Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, Tweedy was unsure of Bennett's abilities against those of O'Rourke. Tweedy and Bennett frequently argued over whether the album should be accessible to a general listener, or attempt to cover new musical ground. Unbeknownst to Bennett, Tweedy invited O'Rourke to remix ""I Am Trying to Break Your Heart"", and the results impressed the other band members--even Bennett. Tensions grew between Bennett and O'Rourke because Bennett wanted to mix every song on the album. O'Rourke cut the contributions of other members on several of the songs; some songs, such as ""Poor Places"", only featured the Loose Fur trio. The album was completed in 2001, and Bennett left the band immediately afterwards. The recording of the album was documented by Sam Jones and released in 2002 as the film I Am Trying to Break Your Heart.  Time Warner, which owned Warner Brothers, merged with America Online in 2001, leading to more pressure on Warner's record labels to cut costs. Over 600 employees of Warner Music Group were fired, including Howie Klein, the president of Reprise Records. In absence of Klein, David Kahne became the interim head of Reprise. Kahne assigned Mio Vukovic to monitor the progress of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and to offer suggestions. Music journalist Greg Kot claims that Vukovic disdained the album and was unhappy that Wilco ignored his suggestions. He brought the album to Kahne, who felt that there was no single on the album. In June 2001, the album was rejected by Reprise and Wilco was asked to leave the label.  Wilco managed to negotiate terms to a buy-out from Reprise. Music journalist Greg Kot claims that instead of financial compensation, the band agreed to leave the label with the master tapes of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. The label was already receiving bad publicity for its treatment of the band and were willing to accommodate Wilco's request. However, Allmusic claims that Wilco ""bought the finished studio tapes from Warner/Reprise for a reported $50,000 and left the label altogether"" after Wilco was ""unwilling to change the album to make it more 'commercially viable.'"" To curb the negative publicity, Reprise began to invest more in bands such as The Flaming Lips. Lead singer Wayne Coyne once remarked: ""We are benefiting from the label's regret over Wilco. We are living in the golden age of that being such a public mistake. The people on Warners said, 'we'll never have a band like Wilco feel we don't believe in them again.' They'd tell me that it would never happen to us. And what a great day for me!"" As the band searched for a new label to release the album, they decided to stream it at their official website to discourage illegal trading of low-quality MP3s. The band signed with Nonesuch Records, another Time Warner subsidiary, and the album was released in the spring of 2002. When it was released, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot reached number thirteen on the Billboard 200, Wilco's highest chart position to that date. Yankee Hotel Foxtrot sold over 590,000 copies, and to date remains Wilco's best selling album. Yankee Hotel Foxtrot was met with wide critical acclaim: it topped 2002's Pazz & Jop critics' poll, was named one of the 100 greatest albums of all time by Q Magazine, and was named one of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time by Rolling Stone.  Down with Wilco, A Ghost Is Born, and Kicking Television: Live in Chicago  While waiting for the commercial release of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, Wilco agreed to support R.E.M. collaborator Scott McCaughey for an album release by The Minus 5. They scheduled a recording session for September 11, 2001, but were distraught about the 9/11 terrorist attacks that day. Later that day, Wilco and McCaughey agreed to ""create something good in the world right now"" and record some material. Influenced by Bill Fay's Time Of The Last Persecution, The Minus 5's Down With Wilco was released in 2003.  In November 2003, Wilco traveled to New York City to record their fifth album. Unlike Summerteeth and Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, A Ghost is Born featured songs that were created with Pro Tools before ever performing them live. The album featured the song ""Less Than You Think"", which included a fifteen-minute track of electronic noises and synthesizers, which Tweedy called ""the track that everyone will hate"". Tweedy justified the inclusion of the song: ""I know ninety-nine percent of our fans won't like that song, they'll say its a ridiculous indulgence. Even I don't want to listen to it every time I play through the album. But the times I do calm myself down and pay attention to it, I think it's valuable and moving and cathartic. I wouldn't have put it on the record if I didn't think it was great ... I wanted to make an album about identity, and within that is the idea of a higher power, the idea of randomness, and that anything can happen, and that we can't control it."" Leroy Bach left the band immediately after the album's completion to join a music theatre operation in Chicago. Like Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, Wilco streamed the album online before its commercial release. Instead of using their own web page, the band streamed it in MPEG-4 form on Apple's website. Wilco sought to substantially change their lineup after Bach's departure, and added Mikael Jorgensen, who had engineered Down With Wilco, Pat Sansone of The Autumn Defense, and avant-garde guitarist Nels Cline to the lineup. Just as the band was about to tour to promote the album, Tweedy checked himself in to a rehabilitation clinic in Chicago for an addiction to painkillers. As a result, tour plans for Europe were canceled, and the release date for the album was set back several weeks. A Ghost is Born was released on June 22, 2004, and became Wilco's first top ten album in the U.S. The album earned Wilco Grammy Awards for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Recording Package in 2005. It also placed thirteenth on 2004's Pazz & Jop Critics Poll.  In 2004, the band released The Wilco Book, a picture book detailing the creation of A Ghost is Born. The book also contains writings and drawings from band members, as well as a CD with demos from the A Ghost is Born recording sessions. Also that year, Chicago Tribune music critic Greg Kot released a biography of the band entitled Wilco: Learning How to Die. The new six-piece Wilco lineup debuted on Kicking Television: Live in Chicago, a two disc live album recorded at The Vic Theater in Chicago. Released on November 15, 2005, the album received high accolades from Spin, Billboard, and Entertainment Weekly. As of 2007, it has sold over 114,000 copies.  Sky Blue Sky  Wilco returned to their loft in Chicago to record a sixth studio album in 2006. Influenced by The Byrds and Fairport Convention, the band considered Sky Blue Sky to be less experimental than previous releases. Also unlike previous albums, the songs were created as collaborations.  Wilco streamed the album online on March 3, 2007, and offered the song ""What Light"" as a free MP3 download. To further publicize the album, Wilco licensed several songs from the Sky Blue Sky recording sessions for use in a Volkswagen advertising campaign. The move was criticized by both critics and fans; Wilco responded by noting that they had previously done advertising campaigns with Apple Computers and Telefónica Móviles (Movistar). The album was released on May 15, 2007, and was a commercial success: it sold over 87,000 copies in its first week and peaked in the top five in the U.S. album charts. It also was a top forty hit in seven other countries.  Reviewer James Brubaker states that Wilco ""shines on a handful of the songs"" on Sky Blue Sky, such as the ""light, and straightforward"" songs. While he calls the album ""great traditional rock and folk album at times"", he states that ""once you get past the handful of masterful and lovely performances... the rest of the record comes off at times as dull, and forced"". The allaboutjazz review also had mixed comments. While praising the album as ""deceptively insinuating, almost intoxicating to listen to"" and noting its ""impeccable sound quality"", the reviewer claimed that ""Sky Blue Sky becomes the first Wilco album that sounds too careful for its own good.""  Pabs Hernandez, a reviewer for Lost at Sea praised the album's ""breezy atmosphere and pacing"", and noted that it is not ""easily judged upon first listen."" Overall, Hernandez stated that it ""may be no masterpiece, but at worst it's a more than worthy entry into Wilco's laudable catalogue."" Reviewer Greg Locke praised the record as ""one of the best albums of the year"", calling it a ""timeless record, full of sweet, hopeful sophistication and class"" and ""a lean, mean, soulful album."" Like Hernandez, Locke acknowledged that the album could not be properly judged just on the first listening. The NPR review also had a positive take on the record. While the NPR reviewer stated that the recording ""isn't groundbreaking"", they praised its ""coherent musical expression"" and emphasis on ""solid songcraft without pretense"" which created a ""satisfying and melodically sound albu[m].""  Musical style and influence  Wilco's music is typically categorized as alternative rock and alternative country. Despite their career long association with a major record label, they are generally associated with indie rock. Wilco draws influence from bands from a variety of musical genres, but primarily from music created between 1966 and 1974. John Cale's Paris 1919 was credited by the band as providing a musical parallel. According to Tweedy, ""It was eye-opening that I wasn't the only person that felt like these worlds had a lot more in common than they'd been given credit for--that experimentation and avant-garde theory was not directly opposed to beauty, y'know?""  Other recording artists from that timespan appreciated by the band include John Lennon, Neil Young, and Brian Wilson. For his thirty-fourth birthday, Tweedy received a private guitar lesson from Richard Lloyd of Television; Tweedy was a big fan of the group and was particularly fond of the guitar work, which he wanted to incorporate into his music. Uncle Tupelo was inspired by bands such as Jason & The Scorchers and The Minutemen, influencing the recording of Wilco's A.M.. Tweedy and O'Rourke enjoyed free jazz artists such as Ornette Coleman, Albert Ayler, and Derek Bailey; they also listen to mainstream jazz by artists such as Miles Davis and John Coltrane. The lyrical structure of Wilco's songs were dictated by classic literature and cadavre exquis--an exercise where band members take turns writing lines on a typewriter, but are only allowed to see the previously written line. Among the books that the band has cited as being stylistically influential include William H. Gass's In the Heart of the Heart of the Country, Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer, and Harold Bloom's The Anxiety of Influence: A Theory of Poetry.  Some critics have dubbed Wilco the ""American Radiohead"", due to their stylistically diverse catalog. A critic from the New York Times argues that Wilco has a ""roots-rock...[sound which] reached back to proven materials: the twang of country, the steady chug of 1960s rock, the undulating sheen of The Beach Boys, the honky-tonk hymns of The Band and the melodic symmetries of pop.""  Rolling Stone described Wilco as ""one of America's most consistently interesting bands"" and ""America's foremost rock impressionists."" Despite critical acclaim, Wilco's influence on modern rock has been limited. Bands that have been influenced by Wilco include Derek Webb (of Caedmon's Call), The National, and Grace Potter and the Nocturnals. English indie rock band Cherry Ghost took its name from a lyric from the Wilco song ""Theologians"" (from A Ghost is Born)--lead singer Simon Aldred is a self-proclaimed ""massive Wilco fan"". Pete Yorn's song ""Crystal Village"" was influenced by Wilco's ""She's A Jar."" On his 2004 album Live From New Jersey he introduces the song by saying, ""Someone accused me of ripping off Cat Stevens. And I was like, 'That's bullshit, man. I would never rip off Cat Stevens.' I ripped off Wilco on that song.""  http://www.wilcoworld.net, Since its very beginning, Wilco has continually sought to explore ..., www.wilcoworld.net, When pioneering alt-country band Uncle Tupelo split in the mid-1990s, ..., a band, Wilco rose from the ashes of the seminal roots rockers ..., Wilco rose from the ashes of the seminal roots rock ..., After seven studio albums, various collaborations and countless days on ..., Wilco is an American alternative rock band based in Chicago, Illinois. The band was formed in 1994 by the remaining members of alternative country group Uncle Tupelo following singer Jay Farrar's departure. Wilco's lineup changed frequently during its first decade, with only singer Jeff Tweedy and bassist John Stirratt remaining from the original incarnation. Since early 2004, the lineup has been unchanged, consisting of Tweedy, Stirratt, guitarist Nels Cline, multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansone, keyboard player Mikael Jorgensen, and drummer Glenn Kotche. Wilco has released eight studio albums, a live double album, and four collaborations: three with Billy Bragg and one with The Minus 5. 
Wilco's music has been inspired by a wide variety of artists and styles, including Bill Fay, The Beatles and Television, and has in turn influenced music by a number of modern alternative rock acts. The band continued in the alternative country of Uncle Tupelo on its debut album A.M. (1995), but has since introduced more experimental aspects to their music, including elements of alternative rock and classic pop. Wilco's musical style has evolved from a 1990s country rock sound to a current ""eclectic indie rock collective that touches on many eras and genres."" 
Wilco garnered media attention for its fourth album, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot (2002), and the controversy surrounding it. After the recording sessions were complete, Reprise Records rejected the album and dismissed Wilco from the label. As part of a buy-out deal, Reprise gave Wilco the rights to the album for free. After streaming Foxtrot on its website, Wilco sold the album to Nonesuch Records in 2002. Both record labels are subsidiaries of Warner Music Group, leading one critic to say the album showed ""how screwed up the music business is in the early twenty-first century.""Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is Wilco's most successful release to date, selling over 670,000 copies. Wilco won two Grammy Awards for their fifth studio album, 2004's A Ghost Is Born, including Best Alternative Music Album. Wilco's most recent studio album, The Whole Love, was released on September 27, 2011. 

History:

Formation:
Wilco was formed following the breakup of the influential alternative country music group Uncle Tupelo. Singer Jay Farrar quit the band in 1994 supposedly because of a soured relationship with co-singer Jeff Tweedy. Both Tweedy and Farrar sought to form bands immediately after the breakup. Tweedy was able to keep the entire Uncle Tupelo lineup sans Farrar, including bassist John Stirratt, drummer Ken Coomer, and multi-instrumentalist Max Johnston. He even enlisted Uncle Tupelo guest guitarist Brian Henneman of the Bottle Rockets, who performed on many of the tracks for Wilco's debut album, A.M.. The band was tempted to keep the Uncle Tupelo name, but ultimately decided to rename the band. The group named itself ""Wilco"" after the military and commercial aviation radio voice abbreviation for ""will comply"", a choice which Tweedy has called ""fairly ironic for a rock band to name themselves."" 

A.M. and Being There:
After collaborating with Syd Straw on a cover version of the Ernest Tubb song ""The T.B. is Whipping Me"" (released in September 1994 on the Red Hot + Country compilation produced by the Red Hot Organization), Wilco began recording tracks for A.M., their first studio album, at Easley studio in June 1994. A demo tape from these recordings was sent to executives at Reprise Records, a subsidiary of Warner Brothers, and the label signed Tweedy to a contract. Although Tweedy stated that he wanted a more collaborative project than Uncle Tupelo, only his name appeared on the Reprise contract. Tweedy requested songwriting submissions from other members, but only one submission--John Stirratt's ""It's Just That Simple""--appeared on A.M.. It was the last song Wilco ever released that was lyrically solely written by a member besides Tweedy. 
Stylistically similar to Uncle Tupelo, the music on A.M. was considered to be straightforward alternative country rock in what Tweedy later described as ""trying to tread some water with a perceived audience.""A.M. peaked at number twenty-seven on the Billboard Heatseekers chart, considerably lower than the debut album of Jay Farrar's new band, Son Volt. The album was met with modest reviews though it would rank thirty-fourth in the Village Voice's 1995 Pazz & Jop critics poll. Critically and commercially paling in comparison to the reception of Son Volt's album, the Wilco members perceived A.M. to be a failure. Shortly after the release of the album, multi-instrumentalist Jay Bennett joined the band, providing the band with a keyboardist and another guitarist. 
Wilco made its live debut on November 17, 1994 to a capacity crowd at Cicero's Basement Bar in St. Louis, Missouri (the band was billed for the occasion as ""Black Shampoo""). 
During the two hundred-date tour supporting A.M., Tweedy began to write songs for a second album. The lyrical theme of the songs reflected a relationship between musical artist and a listener; Tweedy chose this topic because he sought to eschew the alternative country fan base. Ken Coomer elaborated: 

The whole No Depression thing was funny to us because people seemed to forget that Jeff was a bigger punk-rock fan than a country fan. It led to things like us all switching instruments on ""Misunderstood,"" where I'm playing guitar. 

A number of songs were recorded with this theme, including ""Sunken Treasure"" and ""Hotel Arizona"", however, Wilco also recorded a number of songs in the style of A.M. Wilco named the album Being There after a Peter Sellers film of the same name. The band went through some personnel changes during the recording sessions. Max Johnston left the band because he felt that his role in the band had diminished in favor of Bennett; he had also been replaced by violinist Jesse Greene on one track because the band felt that Johnston was unable to play the part. Bob Egan of Freakwater briefly joined the band in the studio, playing pedal steel guitar on ""Far, Far Away"" and ""Dreamer in My Dreams"", and then became an official member in September 1996. 
Unlike the A.M. recording sessions, the band had no vocation for producing a hit song from their second effort. The recording sessions produced nineteen songs, too many for a single album release. Tweedy was concerned about the high retail price that a double album would be sold for (at least $30), so he asked Reprise Records to release it as a double album at a single album price ($17.98 or less). Reprise agreed to this on the terms that they received Wilco's share of the album royalties. It was estimated in 2003 that the band lost almost $600,000 on the deal, but Tweedy was satisfied.Being There was well received by critics from several major media outlets, including Rolling Stone. The album reached No. 73 on the Billboard album charts, a significant improvement from A.M., and placed fourteenth on the Pazz & Jop Critics Poll for 1996. 

Summerteeth and the Mermaid Avenue sessions:
In November 1997, Wilco entered Willie Nelson's recording studio in Spicewood, Texas to record a third studio album. The album was lyrically inspired by the marital problems of Tweedy and his wife, as well as by twentieth-century literature. Tweedy relied heavily on Bennett to provide music for the singer's ""bold, but depressing"" lyrics. Wilco recorded several songs, including ""Via Chicago"" and ""She's a Jar,"" but began working on another project before assembling the tracks into an album. 

Nora Guthrie contacted singer-songwriter Billy Bragg in spring 1995 about recording some unreleased songs by her father, folk singer Woody Guthrie. Most of the songs were written late in Guthrie's life when he was unable to record due to the motor impairments of Huntington's disease. By the 1990s, Woody Guthrie had become a ""relic"" to the MTV generation, and Nora sought to establish a different legacy for the musician. To Nora, Bragg was ""the only singer I knew taking on the same issues as Woody."" Bragg was concerned, however, that his fans would not realize that the songs were written by Guthrie when he performed them on tour, so he decided to record the album with another band. 
Bragg contacted Tweedy and Bennett about co-recording the album while Wilco was on the European segment of their Being There tour. Bragg was particularly fond of Being There because their influences extended farther back than the 1950s. Although Tweedy was indifferent to the offer, Bennett was enthused about recording songs of one of his idols--Bennett's previous band Titanic Love Affair was named after a Billy Bragg lyric. A recording contract between Bragg and Wilco was signed after a show at Shepherd's Bush Empire. Bragg mostly recorded the politically charged lyrics, while Tweedy preferred to record lyrics that showcased Guthrie as a ""freak weirdo"". The recording of Mermaid Avenue began on December 12, 1997, and was the topic of BBC's Man in the Sand documentary film. 
Tempers flared between Bragg and Wilco after the album was completed. Bennett believed that Bragg was overproducing his songs, a sharp contrast to Wilco's sparser contributions. Bennett called Bragg about the possibility of remixing Bragg's songs, to which Bragg responded ""you make your record, and I'll make mine, fucker."" Eventually Bragg sent copies of his recordings to Chicago for Bennett to remix, but Bragg refused to use the new mixes on the album. The two parties were unable to establish a promotional tour and quarreled over royalties and guest musician fees. 
Despite these conflicts, the album was released on June 23, 1998, and sold over 277,000 copies. The album received rave reviews from Robert Christgau and Rolling Stone, and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album. It also placed fourth on the Pazz & Jop critics poll for 1998. After the album was released, Bob Egan was replaced by multi-instrumentalist Leroy Bach. 
After the completion of the Mermaid Avenue sessions, Wilco returned to Spicewood to complete their third studio album, Summerteeth. Unlike previous Wilco and Uncle Tupelo recordings, the album featured a lot of overdubbing with Pro Tools. Stirratt and Coomer were concerned with the production, since it reduced their involvement in the music. According to Stirratt: 

The story of Summerteeth is Jay bought a Mellotron and he was going to use it, no matter what. It was lovely, but it was overdone. Once they got going on the overdubs, they didn't stop. And nobody in the band stepped up to stop the madness ... It reminds me of Heart of Darkness, where you knowingly extend the creative process for the purpose of exploration or redemption, or whatever it is you're looking for. 

During 1999, Warner Brothers was looking to help repay a $16 billion debt acquired during the recent merger of parent company Warner Communications with Time Inc.. As a result, Warner's imprints were under pressure to produce musical acts that would yield hit records. The head of Reprise, Howie Klein, who had previously authorized the release of Being There as a double album, was willing to let Wilco produce Summerteeth without label input. When Klein played the album for Reprise's A&R department, however, they demanded a radio single for the album. Wilco agreed to do this ""once and once only"" and recorded a radio-friendly version of ""Can't Stand It"" at the request of David Kahne, the head of the A&R department. The single version of ""Can't Stand It"" failed to cross over from Triple-A radio to alternative rock stations. Consequently, the album sold only 200,000 copies, significantly less than Being There. This was despite critical acclaim; the album placed eighth on the Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 1999. 
After the release of Summerteeth, the band resumed the Mermaid Avenue sessions. Although they had recorded enough material for a second release in 1998, Wilco recorded a few new songs for Mermaid Avenue Vol. II. ""Someday Some Morning Sometime,"" featuring a vibraphone filtered through a space echo, was identified by Tweedy as being the ""piece to the puzzle"" towards the creation of their fourth studio album. The album was released on May 30, 2000, and was the last release from the sessions. The remainder of the sessions were released in 2012 as Mermaid Avenue Vol. III, also part of Mermaid Avenue: The Complete Sessions. 

Yankee Hotel Foxtrot:

Shortly after the recording sessions for Mermaid Avenue Vol. II, Wilco purchased a studio on Irving Park Road in Chicago, which they named the Wilco Loft. The band recorded some tracks in the studio in early 2000 for a fourth studio album. In May 2000, Jeff Tweedy requested to perform with Jim O'Rourke at a festival in Chicago; Tweedy was a fan of O'Rourke's Bad Timing. O'Rourke introduced Tweedy to drummer Glenn Kotche, and the trio enjoyed working together so much that they decided to record an album as a side project named Loose Fur. Wilco had recorded an entire album of music at this point, but Tweedy was unhappy with the drum parts. He enjoyed Kotche's contributions to Loose Fur so much that Tweedy brought him into the studio to re-record some demos. Some believe that Tweedy sought to make Wilco sound like Loose Fur after officially replacing Ken Coomer with Kotche in January 2001. 
Although Bennett sought to act as both mixer and engineer for Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, Tweedy was unsure of Bennett's abilities against those of O'Rourke. Tweedy and Bennett frequently argued over whether the album should be accessible to a general listener, or attempt to cover new musical ground. Unbeknownst to Bennett, Tweedy invited O'Rourke to remix ""I Am Trying to Break Your Heart"", and the results impressed the other band members--even Bennett. Tensions grew between Bennett and O'Rourke because Bennett wanted to mix every song on the album. O'Rourke cut the contributions of other members on several of the songs; some songs, such as ""Poor Places"", only featured the Loose Fur trio. The album was completed in 2001, and Bennett was dismissed from the band immediately afterwards. The recording of the album was documented by Sam Jones and released in 2002 as the film I Am Trying to Break Your Heart: A Film About Wilco. 
Time Warner, which owned Warner Bros. Records, merged with America Online in 2001, leading to more pressure on Warner's record labels to cut costs. Over 600 employees of Warner Music Group were fired, including Howie Klein, the president of Reprise Records. In absence of Klein, David Kahne became the interim head of Reprise. Kahne assigned Mio Vukovic to monitor the progress of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and to offer suggestions. Music journalist Greg Kot claims that Vukovic disdained the album and was unhappy that Wilco ignored his suggestions. He brought the album to Kahne, who felt that there was no single on the album. In June 2001, the album was rejected by Reprise and Wilco was asked to leave the label. 
Wilco managed to negotiate terms to a buy-out from Reprise. Music journalist Greg Kot claims that instead of financial compensation, the band agreed to leave the label with the master tapes of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. The label was already receiving bad publicity for its treatment of the band and were willing to accommodate Wilco's request. However, Allmusic claims that Wilco ""bought the finished studio tapes from Warner/Reprise for a reported $50,000 and left the label altogether"" after Wilco was ""unwilling to change the album to make it more 'commercially viable'"" To curb the negative publicity, Reprise began to invest more in bands such as The Flaming Lips. Lead singer Wayne Coyne once remarked: 

We are benefiting from the label's regret over Wilco. We are living in the golden age of that being such a public mistake. The people on Warners said, ""we'll never have a band like Wilco feel we don't believe in them again."" They'd tell me that it would never happen to us. And what a great day for me! 

As the band searched for a new label to release the album, they decided to stream it at their official website to discourage illegal trading of low-quality MP3s. The band signed with Nonesuch Records, another Time Warner subsidiary, and the album was released in the spring of 2002. When it was released, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot reached number thirteen on the Billboard 200, Wilco's highest chart position to that date.Yankee Hotel Foxtrot sold over 590,000 copies, and to date remains Wilco's best selling album.Yankee Hotel Foxtrot was met with wide critical acclaim: it topped 2002's Pazz & Jop critics' poll, was named one of the 100 greatest albums of all time by Q Magazine. 
Rolling Stone rated it one of the top 500 albums of all time in May 2012. 

Down with Wilco, A Ghost Is Born, and Kicking Television: Live in Chicago:
While waiting for the commercial release of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, Wilco agreed to support R.E.M. collaborator Scott McCaughey for an album release by The Minus 5. They scheduled a recording session for September 11, 2001, but were distraught about the 9/11 terrorist attacks that day. Later that day, Wilco and McCaughey agreed to ""create something good in the world right now"" and record some material. Influenced by Bill Fay's Time of the Last Persecution, The Minus 5's Down with Wilco was released in 2003. Keyboardist Mikael Jorgensen, who had engineered Down with Wilco, joined Wilco in 2002 as they toured in support of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. 

In November 2003, Wilco traveled to New York City to record their fifth album. The album was produced by Jim O'Rourke, who mixed Foxtrot and was a member of Wilco side project Loose Fur. Unlike Summerteeth and Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, A Ghost Is Born featured songs that were created with Pro Tools before ever performing them live. The album featured the song ""Less Than You Think"", which included a fifteen-minute track of electronic noises and synthesizers, which Tweedy called ""the track that everyone will hate"". Tweedy justified the inclusion of the song: 

I know ninety-nine percent of our fans won't like that song, they'll say it's a ridiculous indulgence. Even I don't want to listen to it every time I play through the album. But the times I do calm myself down and pay attention to it, I think it's valuable and moving and cathartic. I wouldn't have put it on the record if I didn't think it was great ... I wanted to make an album about identity, and within that is the idea of a higher power, the idea of randomness, and that anything can happen, and that we can't control it. 

Leroy Bach left the band immediately after the album's completion to join a music theatre operation in Chicago. Like Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, Wilco streamed the album online before its commercial release. Instead of using their own web page, the band streamed it in MPEG-4 form on Apple's website. Wilco sought to substantially change their lineup after Bach's departure, and added Pat Sansone of The Autumn Defense, and avant-garde guitarist Nels Cline to the lineup. Just as the band was about to tour to promote the album, Tweedy checked himself into a rehabilitation clinic in Chicago for an addiction to opioids. As a result, tour plans for Europe were canceled, and the release date for the album was set back several weeks.A Ghost Is Born was released on June 22, 2004, and became Wilco's first top ten album in the U.S. The album earned Wilco Grammy Awards for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Recording Package in 2005. It also placed thirteenth on 2004's Pazz & Jop Critics Poll. 
In 2004, the band released The Wilco Book, a picture book detailing the creation of A Ghost Is Born. The book also contains writings and drawings from band members, as well as a CD with demos from the A Ghost Is Born recording sessions. Also that year, Chicago Tribune music critic Greg Kot released a biography of the band entitled Wilco: Learning How to Die. The new six-piece Wilco lineup debuted on Kicking Television: Live in Chicago, a two disc live album recorded at The Vic Theater in Chicago. Released on November 15, 2005, the album received high accolades from Spin, Billboard, and Entertainment Weekly. As of 2007, it has sold over 114,000 copies. 

Sky Blue Sky:
Wilco returned to their loft in Chicago to record a sixth studio album in 2006. Influenced by The Byrds and Fairport Convention, the band considered Sky Blue Sky to be less experimental than previous releases. Also unlike previous albums, the songs were created as collaborations. 
Wilco streamed the album online on March 3, 2007, and offered the song ""What Light"" as a free MP3 download. To further publicize the album, Wilco licensed several songs from the Sky Blue Sky recording sessions for use in a Volkswagen advertising campaign. The move was criticized by both critics and fans; Wilco responded by noting that they had previously done advertising campaigns with Apple Inc. and Telefónica Móviles (Movistar). The album was released on May 15, 2007, and was a commercial success: it sold over 87,000 copies in its first week and peaked in the top five in the U.S. album charts. It also was a top forty hit in seven other countries. 
Reviewer James Brubaker states that Wilco ""shines on a handful of the songs"" on Sky Blue Sky, such as the ""light, and straightforward"" songs. While he calls the album ""great traditional rock and folk album at times"", he states that ""once you get past the handful of masterful and lovely performances ... the rest of the record comes off at times as dull, and forced."" The allaboutjazz review also had mixed comments. While praising the album as ""deceptively insinuating, almost intoxicating to listen to"" and noting its ""impeccable sound quality,"" the reviewer claimed that ""Sky Blue Sky becomes the first Wilco album that sounds too careful for its own good."" 
Pabs Hernandez, a reviewer for Lost at Sea praised the album's ""breezy atmosphere and pacing,"" and noted that it is not ""easily judged upon first listen."" Overall, Hernandez stated that it ""may be no masterpiece, but at worst it's a more than worthy entry into Wilco's laudable catalogue."" Reviewer Greg Locke praised the record as ""one of the best albums of the year,"" calling it a ""timeless record, full of sweet, hopeful sophistication and class"" and ""a lean, mean, soulful album."" Like Hernandez, Locke acknowledged that the album could not be properly judged just on the first listening. The NPR review also had a positive take on the record. While the NPR reviewer stated that the recording ""isn't groundbreaking,"" they praised its ""coherent musical expression"" and emphasis on ""solid songcraft without pretense"" which created a ""satisfying and melodically sound album."" 
In anticipation of the 2008 US presidential election, Wilco released a downloadable version of Bob Dylan's ""I Shall Be Released"" that they performed with Fleet Foxes. The MP3 was available as a free download from the band's website in exchange for a promise to vote in the election. The band also made an appearance on The Colbert Report to support presidential candidate Barack Obama. Wilco released a live performance DVD, Ashes of American Flags, on April 18, 2009, to celebrate Record Store Day. 
In December 2008, Jeff Tweedy, Pat Sansone, Glenn Kotche and John Stirratt traveled to Auckland, New Zealand to participate in Neil Finn's 7 Worlds Collide sequel project, The Sun Came Out, joined by Ed O'Brien, Phil Selway, Johnny Marr, KT Tunstall, Liam Finn, and Lisa Germano. They wrote and recorded several new tracks for the Oxfam-benefiting album including ""You Never Know"", ""What Could Have Been"", ""Over and Done"" and ""Don't Forget Me"". Jeff Tweedy co-wrote ""Too Blue"" with Johnny Marr, and Glenn, John and Pat play on most tracks on the album. 
Having enjoyed their time in New Zealand and the vibe of Finn's own Roundhead Studios, the four members stayed in Auckland through January to record the foundation tracks for their next album. Jim Scott, who acted as engineer and mixer for the Neil Finn project, stayed on in the same capacity for the Wilco sessions. Nels Cline and Mikael Jorgensen would later add overdubs to these tracks at the band's Chicago Loft. 

Wilco (The Album):
Wilco released their seventh album, Wilco (The Album), on June 30, 2009. In March 2009, it was announced that singer-songwriter Feist would make a guest appearance on the new album, on the track ""You and I"". Like their previous three albums, Wilco streamed the entirety of the album on its website prior to release. The album hit the charts at a career-high No. 4 with sales of 99,000 on the Billboard Top 200 Album chart as well as the No. 2 spot on Billboard's Top Rock Albums chart. It marked Wilco's third top 10 album on the U.S. pop chart. The album's first single ""You Never Know"" reached the No. 1 spot on the AAA Chart, their first No. 1 in twelve years. 
Beginning in April 2009, the band freely distributed a cover of Woody Guthrie's ""The Jolly Banker"", downloadable from their website. It was recorded at the Wilco loft in February of that year, at the suggestion of Guthrie's daughter, Nora. Downloaders were encouraged to donate to the Woody Guthrie Foundation. Feist returned to accompany on the track, playing the Garden Weasel. The track eventually became unavailable for download. In October 2011, the website began streaming the track via a plugin. 
On May 25, 2009, former band member Jay Bennett died in his home in Urbana, Illinois. In a prepared statement, Jeff Tweedy remarked that he was ""deeply saddened"" by Bennett's death. 
Feist and Wilco performed ""You and I"" on Late Show with David Letterman on July 14, 2009. In June during their West Coast tour, Wilco joined Beck, Feist, Jamie Lidell and James Gadson in the studio to take part in Beck's Record Club project, covering Skip Spence's Oar album. The first song ""Little Hands"" was posted on Beck's website on November 12, 2009. 
On April 6, 2010, Wilco announced during their Boston performance that they would be headlining and curating a festival in North Adams, Massachusetts, dubbed Solid Sound Festival. The event ran at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art from August 13-15, and featured various Wilco side projects, including The Autumn Defense, Pronto, The Nels Cline Singers, and Jeff Tweedy solo. Other bands who appeared included Mavis Staples, Avi Buffalo, Outrageous Cherry, Richard Bishop, The Books, and Vetiver. It also featured non-musical media, such as the Bread and Puppet Theater and comedians Todd Barry, Kristen Schaal, John Mulaney, and Hannibal Buress as well as interactive musical installations by Cline and Kotche. 
Wilco's contract with Nonesuch ended in 2010 and they formed their own label. Wilco announced via their web site and Twitter page on January 27, 2011 that the new label will be called dBpm Records (Decibels per Minute) and will be run out of the offices of their manager, Tony Margherita, in Easthampton, Massachusetts. 

The Whole Love:
Wilco's eighth studio album, The Whole Love, was released on September 27, 2011. The first single of the album is titled ""Art of Almost"". The B-Side to ""I Might"" is a cover of Nick Lowe's 1977 song ""I Love My Label"". The single was shown at the Wilco's 2011 Solid Sound Festival at MassMoca and was met by positive reviews. The entire album was streamed live on Wilco's official website for 24 hours between September 3 and 4, 2011. 

Musical style and influence:

Wilco's music is typically categorized as alternative rock and alternative country. Despite their career-long association with a major record label, they are generally associated with indie rock. Wilco draws influence from bands from a variety of musical genres, but primarily from music created between 1966 and 1974.John Cale's Paris 1919 was credited by the band as providing a musical parallel. According to Tweedy, ""It was eye-opening that I wasn't the only person that felt like these worlds had a lot more in common than they'd been given credit for--that experimentation and avant-garde theory was not directly opposed to beauty, y'know?"" 
Other recording artists from that timespan appreciated by the band include John Lennon, Neil Young, and Brian Wilson. For his thirty-fourth birthday, Tweedy received a private guitar lesson from Richard Lloyd of Television; Tweedy was a fan of the group and was particularly fond of the guitar work, which he wanted to incorporate into his music. Uncle Tupelo was inspired by bands such as Jason & the Scorchers and The Minutemen, influencing the recording of Wilco's A.M.. Tweedy and O'Rourke enjoyed free jazz artists such as Ornette Coleman, Albert Ayler, and Derek Bailey; they also listen to mainstream jazz by artists such as Miles Davis and John Coltrane. The lyrical structure of Wilco's songs was dictated by classic literature and cadavre exquis--an exercise where band members take turns writing lines on a typewriter, but are only allowed to see the previously written line. Among the books that the band has cited as being stylistically influential include William H. Gass's In the Heart of the Heart of the Country, Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer, and Harold Bloom's The Anxiety of Influence: A Theory of Poetry. 
Some critics have dubbed Wilco the ""American Radiohead"", due to their stylistically diverse catalog. A critic from the New York Times argues that Wilco has a ""roots-rock ... sound which reached back to proven materials: the twang of country, the steady chug of 1960s rock, the undulating sheen of the Beach Boys, the honky-tonk hymns of the Band and the melodic symmetries of pop."" 
Rolling Stone described Wilco as ""one of America's most consistently interesting bands"" and ""America's foremost rock impressionists."" Bands that have been influenced by Wilco include Derek Webb (of Caedmon's Call),The National, and Grace Potter and the Nocturnals. English indie rock band Cherry Ghost took its name from a lyric from the Wilco song ""Theologians"" (from A Ghost Is Born)--lead singer Simon Aldred is a self-proclaimed ""massive Wilco fan"". Other notable artists who have covered Wilco live include Norah Jones performing ""Jesus, Etc."" which took place at the 2008 Bridge School Benefit where they both performed, a version of which was released as a bonus track on her 2009 release The Fall, Widespread Panic, and Counting Crows and the Wallflowers performing ""California Stars.""

Known as ""America's Band"", they are easily recognized by their complex vocal harmonies. Initially recording music that focused on Californian youth culture, halfway through the decade they shifted their attention towards melancholy orchestral pop, and continued to experiment with other genres. With the release of 1974's Endless Summer they became a more popular touring act, playing their greatest hits. They have recorded 36 Billboard Top 40 hits (including four number-one singles), have had over 100 million sales, and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988.  Formed in Hawthorne, California in 1961, the original group comprised singer-musician-composer Brian Wilson, his brothers Carl Wilson and Dennis Wilson, their cousin Mike Love, and friends Al Jardine and David Marks.  South African musicians Blondie Chaplin and Ricky Fataar played and sang with the band on three key albums during the early 1970s. Many changes in both musical style and personnel have occurred in their sometimes-stormy career: Brian Wilson's mental illness, drug addiction and eventual withdrawal from the group; the deaths of Dennis Wilson in 1983 and Carl Wilson in 1998; and continuing legal battles among surviving members of the group.  In December 2011, five of the group's surviving members - Brian, Mike, Al, Bruce and David (But not Blondie or Ricky) - reformed in celebration of their 50th anniversary, announcing that a new album and a 50-date international tour had been planned for 2012. The tour begun in on April 24, 2012 with a headlining performance at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival. Songfacts reports that the first single from the  album, That's Why God Made the Radio, made it's national radio debut on April 25, 2012 on ESPN's Mike and Mike in the Morning.  Early Years  The group was formed in 1961 in Hawthorne, California under the leadership of Brian Wilson, and included his brothers Carl and Dennis, their cousin Mike Love and school friend Al Jardine.  The early inspirations of the group were the Wilsons' musician father, Murry, and the close vocal harmonies of groups such as The Four Freshmen. The group performed initially as The Pendletones, after the Pendleton woolen shirts popular then. Although surfing motifs were very prominent in their early songs, Dennis was the sole actual surfer in the group. He suggested to his brothers that they do some songs celebrating his hobby and the lifestyle which had developed around it in Southern California.  At first Murry Wilson, by many accounts a hard-driving man, steered The Beach Boys' career, engineering their signing with Capitol Records in 1962. In 1964 Brian Wilson fired his father after a violent confrontation in the studio. Over the next few years they became increasingly estranged; when Murry died some years later, Brian and Dennis did not attend the funeral.  The Beach Boys' early material focused on the California youth lifestyle (e.g., ""All Summer Long"", ""Fun, Fun, Fun""), cars (""Little Deuce Coupe"") and of course surfing (""Surfin' U.S.A."", ""Surfin' Safari"" and many others). Although their music was bright and accessible, these early works contained remarkably sophisticated musical ideas. During this period, Brian Wilson rapidly progressed to become a melodist, arranger, and producer of world-renowned stature. Their early hits made them major pop stars in America and other countries, although their status as America's top pop group was challenged in 1964 by the emergence of The Beatles, who became The Beach Boys' major creative rival.  Like The Beatles, the Beach Boys showed very fast development during the mid-'60s, drawing upon the innovations of songwriters and producers such as Burt Bacharach and especially Phil Spector. They produced the enduring classic ""California Girls"" in 1965, a banner year for popular music which also saw similarly advanced singles by The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Byrds, and James Brown. But it was the Beach Boys' role to create a myth of American freedom and dreams of adolescence, and increasingly, to articulate a dread of what lay after adolescence.  Brian's innovations and personal difficulties  During 1964, Brian Wilson began to suffer from anxiety attacks, and withdrew from touring to concentrate on song writing and record production. Glen Campbell served as Wilson's replacement on tours, until his own career success required him to leave the group. Bruce Johnston was asked to locate a replacement for Campbell; having failed to find one, Johnston subsequently became a full-time member of the band, first replacing Wilson on the road, and then contributing his talents in the studio.  Wilson's growing mastery of the recording studio and his increasingly sophisticated songs and complex arrangements reached an early peak with the acclaimed LP Pet Sounds (1966). Classic singles from that album, ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"" and ""God Only Knows"" showed Wilson's growing skill as a composer, arranger and producer. ""God Only Knows"" is said to have been the first pop single ever released in the U.S. to have the word ""God"" in the title (because of which many radio stations in the U.S. refused to play it.) ""Caroline, No"" also taken from Pet Sounds, was issued as a Brian Wilson solo single, the only time Brian was credited as a solo artist during the early Capitol years.  The album's meticulously layered harmonies and inventive instrumentation (performed by the cream of Los Angeles session musicians known as The WRECKING CREW) set a new standard for popular music. It remains one of the more evocative releases of the decade, with a distinctive strain of melancholy and nostalgia for youth. The album is still widely regarded as a classic and Paul McCartney has named it one of his favorite albums of all time, (with ""God Only Knows"" as his favorite song) often saying that it was a major influence on The Beatles' album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Despite the critical praise it received, the album was poorly promoted by Capitol Records and failed to become the major hit Brian had hoped it would be (only reaching #10). Its failure to gain wide recognition hurt him deeply.  Because of his withdrawal from touring, Wilson was able to complete almost all the backing for the album while the Beach Boys were on tour in Japan. They returned to find a substantially complete album, requiring only their vocals to finish it off. There was some resistance from within the band to this new direction. Lead singer Mike Love is reported to have been strongly opposed to it, partly because he feared the band would lose its audience if they changed their successful formula, and partly because he personally disliked the new material, which he famously criticized as ""Brian's ego music."" At Love's insistence, Brian changed the title of one song from ""Hang on to Your Ego"" to ""I Know There's an Answer"". Another likely factor in Love's antipathy to Pet Sounds was that Wilson worked extensively on it with outside lyricist Tony Asher rather than with Love, even though Love had co-written the lyrics for many of their earlier songs and was the lead vocalist on most of their early hits. It should also be stated that Love, as recently as February 2008 in a top British music magazine, denies emphatically that he was opposed to Brian's new directions. Quite the contrary, contributing the lyrics to the classic form of ""Good Vibrations,"" which certainly seemed to usher in flower power. He really is tired of this view of him as being Brian's nemesis. He could see Brian was destroying himself and that was what he feared.  Seeking to expand on the advances made on Pet Sounds, Wilson began an even more ambitious project, originally dubbed Dumb Angel. Its first fruit was ""Good Vibrations,"" which Brian described as ""a pocket symphony"". The song became the Beach Boys' biggest hit to date, and a US and UK # 1 single in 1966 -- many critics consider it to be one of the best rock singles of all time. In 1997 it was named the ""Greatest Single of All Time"" by Mojo music magazine, in 2000, VH1 placed it at number 8 on their ""100 Greatest Rock Songs"" list, and in late 2004 Rolling Stone magazine placed it at number 6 on their ""500 Best Songs of All Time"" list. It was also one of the more complex pop productions ever undertaken, and was reputed to have been the most expensive American single ever recorded, costing a reported $16,000 -- more than most pop albums of that time -- with sessions stretching over several months in at least three major studios.  In contrast to his work on Pet Sounds, Wilson adopted a modular approach to ""Good Vibrations"" -- he broke the song into sections and taped multiple versions of each at different studios to take advantage of the different sound of each facility. He then assembled his favorite sections into a master backing track and added vocals. The song's innovative instrumentation included drums, organ, piano, tack piano, two basses, guitars, electro-theremin, harmonica, and cello. The group members recall the ""Good Vibrations"" vocal sessions as among the most demanding of their career.  Even as his personal life deteriorated, Wilson's musical output remained remarkable. The exact nature of his problems was a topic of much speculation. He abused drugs heavily, gained an enormous amount of weight, suffered long bouts of depression, and became paranoid. Several biographies have suggested that his father may have had bipolar disorder, and after years of suffering, Wilson's own condition was eventually diagnosed as schizophrenia.  The story behind ""Smile""  Shortly after completing ""Good Vibrations,"" Wilson met session musician and songwriter Van Dyke Parks, and in late 1966 they began an intense collaboration that resulted in a suite of superb new songs for the Beach Boys' next album, which was originally going to be titled Dumb Angel but was renamed Smile. Using the same methods as on ""Good Vibrations,"" recording began in late 1966 and carried on into early 1967. Although the structure of the album and the exact running order of the songs have been subjects of endless speculation, it is apparent that Wilson and Parks intended Smile to be a continuous suite of songs that were linked both thematically and musically, with the main songs being linked together by small vocal pieces and instrumental segments that elaborated the musical themes of the major songs.  But some of the other Beach Boys -- especially Love -- found the new music too difficult and too far removed from their established style; another serious concern was that the new music was simply not feasible for live performance by the current Beach Boys lineup. Love was bitterly opposed to Smile and was particularly critical of Parks' lyrics; he has also since stated that he was becoming deeply concerned about Wilson's escalating drug intake. The problems came to a head during the recording of ""Cabinessence,"" when Love demanded that Parks explain the meaning of the closing refrain of the song, ""Over and over the crow cries uncover the cornfield."" After a heated argument, Parks walked out and his partnership with Wilson came to an abrupt end.  Many factors combined to focus intense pressure on Wilson as Smile neared completion, including mental instability, the pressure to perform against fierce opposition to his new music, the relatively poor response to Pet Sounds, Carl Wilson's draft resistance, and a major dispute with Capitol. Matters were complicated by his reliance on both prescription and illegal drugs, particularly marijuana and amphetamines, which only exacerbated his underlying mental health problems.  Just weeks before The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band was released, Smile was shelved. Over the next 30 years the legends surrounding Smile grew, until it became the most famous unreleased album in the history of popular music. Some of the tracks were salvaged and rerecorded at Brian's new home studio in drastically scaled-down versions. These were released, along with the completed versions of ""Good Vibrations"" and ""Heroes and Villains"", on the 1967 LP Smiley Smile, which would prove to be a critical and commercial disaster for the group.  Despite the cancellation of Smile, interest in the work remained high and versions of several major tracks -- including ""Our Prayer"", ""Cabinessence"", ""Cool, Cool Water"", and ""Surf's Up"" -- were assembled by Carl Wilson over the next few years and included on later albums. The band was expecting to complete and release Smile even until 1972, when it became clear that only Brian would ever be able to make sense out of the endless fragments that were recorded. A substantial number of original tracks and linking fragments were included on the group's 30th anniversary CD boxed set in 1993. Smile itself, in its original conception, did not surface until Wilson and Parks completed the writing and Brian rerecorded it as a solo project in 2004.  Mid-career brings changes  Following their peak popularity with the song ""Good Vibrations"" was a period of declining commercial success, with Smiley Smile and subsequent albums doing poorly on the US charts (although they fared better in the UK). Their image problems were not helped by the criticism that followed their withdrawal from the bill of the 1967 Monterey International Pop Festival as a result of Carl's draft problems, an event that would undoubtedly have been crucial in establishing their new sound had they been able to present their new material there.  The 1967 album Wild Honey, regarded by many critics as a classic, features exuberant upbeat songs written by Brian and Mike, including the hit ""Darlin'"", and a cover of Stevie Wonder's ""I Was Made to Love Her"". Friends (1968) is a quiet, tuneful, and largely acoustic album, influenced by the group's adoption of the practice of transcendental meditation. The title single, however, backed by Dennis' songwriting debut Little Bird, was their least successful since 1962. This was followed by the single ""Do It Again"", a return to their earlier ""fun in the sun"" style, which was moderately successful in the US, but went to #1 in the UK.  As Brian's health deteriorated in the late 1960s and early 1970s, his song output diminished and he became increasingly withdrawn from the group. To fill the void, the other members of the group began writing songs, and Carl gradually took over leadership of the band, developing into an accomplished producer. To complete their contract with Capitol Records before signing with Reprise, they produced one more album, 20/20 (1969), primarily a collection of leftovers (including some from Smile), cover songs, and several new songs by Dennis. One of Denny's songs, ""Never Learn Not to Love"", featured lyrics by Charles Manson originally titled ""Cease to Exist"". Besides ""Do It Again"", the album included their cover of The Ronettes' ""I Can Hear Music"", their last top 40 hit for seven years.  Their first two Reprise LPs were Sunflower (1970) and 1971's Surf's Up, featuring new songs by Brian and all the group members, plus selections from the aborted Smile project. According to the liner notes for the 2004 version of Smile, Reprise expected the legendary album to be completed and released as part of the new contract, but this was never to be; however, these albums included some of their most evolved and complex music since the Smile period.  The addition of Ricky Fataar and Blondie Chaplin in 1972 led to a dramatic departure in sound for the band. Carl and the Passions - So Tough was an uncharacteristic mix including several songs unrecognizable as the Beach Boys. Although it includes the classic ""Marcella"", many consider the album among their poorest efforts. Continuing with Fataar and Chaplin, Holland (1973) was more successful. The album's lead single ""Sail On Sailor,"" a brief return to the collaboration between Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks, was one of the more emblematic of Beach Boys songs. Although it did not produce any top-40 hits, Holland was popular on free-form FM-radio, and includes several classics including Al Jardine's ""California Saga/California"".  In the summer of 1974 Capitol, in consultation with Love, released a double album compilation of the Beach Boys' pre-Pet Sounds hits, entitled Endless Summer. Helped by a sunny, colorful graphic cover, it caught the mood of the country and surged to #1 on the Billboard album chart, becoming their first gold record since ""Good Vibrations"", and stayed on the album chart for three years. The following year another compilation, Spirit of America, also did well. These sales performances demonstrated that the classic Beach Boys sound was back in fashion.  In 1975, the Beach Boys staged a highly successful joint concert tour with Chicago, with each group performing some of the other's songs, including their previous year's collaboration on Chicago's hit ""Wishing You Were Here"". Beach Boy voices were also heard on Elton John's 1974 hit ""Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me"", but following Holland, the group produced no new music until 1976.  Brian's return  15 Big Ones marked the return of Brian Wilson as a major force in the group. This album includes several new songs composed by Brian, and several of his arrangements of favorite old songs by other artists, including ""Rock and Roll Music"" (which made #5), ""Blueberry Hill"", and ""In The Still of The Night"". Brian and Mike's ""It's OK"" was a return to their earlier ""fun-in-the-sun"" style, and was a moderate hit.  In 1977 the Beach Boys released the LP Love You, a collection of 14 songs mostly written by Brian alone, including more ""fun"" songs (""Honkin' Down the Highway""), a mature love song (""Let's Put Our Hearts Together"") - a quirky mix ranging from infectious to touching to downright silly. Although not a commercial success, the album has since gained the status of a classic within the Beach Boys' oeuvre.  Brian's contributions diminished over the next several albums until he again virtually withdrew from the group. Although he appeared sporadically with them in concert, he contributed little to their performances or recordings. Despite a much-publicised ""Brian's Back"" campaign in the late '70s, most critics believed the group was past their prime. Many expected that Brian would one day become the latest in a long line of celebrity drug casualties.  Deaths of Dennis and Carl Wilson  In the late 70s Dennis Wilson also began to suffer increasingly from drug and alcohol abuse, and some of the group's concert appearances were marred when he and other band members showed up onstage drunk or drugged. The band was forced to publicly apologize after a shambolic performance in Sydney in 1979 during which several members of the group appeared to be drunk. In spite of his own frequent drinking, Dennis Wilson managed to release his first solo work, Pacific Ocean Blue, and to launch the now famed work-in-progress Bambu, with friend and musician Carli Muñoz.  In 1980, the Beach Boys played a Fourth of July concert on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. before a vast crowd. This tradition continued for the next two years, but in 1983 Secretary of the Interior James Watt banned the group from playing on the Mall, saying that rock concerts drew ""an undesirable element"". This drew howls of outrage from the many of the Beach Boys' American fans, who stated that the Beach Boys sound was a very desirable part of the American cultural fabric. First Lady Nancy Reagan apologized, and in 1985 the group appeared on the Mall again. The group most recently appeared on the Mall in 2005 for the Fourth of July concert.  Dennis Wilson's problems had escalated in the early 1980s, and he accidentally drowned in late 1983 while diving from his boat as he drunkenly tried to recover items he had previously thrown overboard. Despite Dennis's death, The Beach Boys soldiered on, and they enjoyed a resurgence of interest later in the 1980s, assisted by tributes such as the David Lee Roth version of ""California Girls"". In 1987, they played with the rap group The Fat Boys, covering the song ""Wipe Out"" and filming a video for it. They scored their first #1 in 22 years with the 1988 song ""Kokomo,"" which was featured on the soundtrack of the hit Tom Cruise movie Cocktail and which became their biggest-selling hit ever. In 1996 they guested with Status Quo on a re-recording of Fun, Fun, Fun, which was a British Top 30 hit.  Members of the band appeared on sitcoms such as Full House (starring sometimes drummer John Stamos) and Home Improvement in the 1990s, as well as touring occasionally, but their declining career contrasted dramatically with the massive public interest and rabid critical praise that followed Brian's gradual return to touring in the 1990s. The critically acclaimed documentary I Just Wasn't Made For These Times, important in restoring Wilson's reputation, saw him performing for the first time with his now adult daughters, Wendy and Carnie, and included glowing tributes to his talents from a host of major music stars of the '60s, '70s, and '80s.  Tragedy struck the Wilson family again in 1998 when Carl Wilson died of lung cancer. In 1997, while Carl was in the hospital fighting his cancer, David Marks rejoined the group, subbing for Carl. After Carl's death, Al Jardine was forced out of the group due to a conflict with Love. Brian Wilson was pursuing a solo career at the time, and had no desire to work with the Beach Boys. Permission was given to Mike Love to tour under the Beach Boys' name, and from 1998 to 2011, ""The Beach Boys"" consisted of Mike Love and Bruce Johnston. Marks toured with them from Carl's death until the summer of 1999, when he left the group due to health reasons. Their tours remained popular, even as they came to be viewed primarily as a nostalgia act. Meanwhile, Brian Wilson and Al Jardine each separately pursued solo careers with their new bands.  Setting aside differences  On June 13, 2006, the major surviving Beach Boys (Brian Wilson, Mike Love, Al Jardine, Bruce Johnston, and David Marks) all set aside their differences and reunited for a celebration of the 40th anniversary of the album Pet Sounds and the double-platinum certification of their greatest hits compilation, Sounds of Summer: The Very Best of the Beach Boys, in a ceremony atop the Capitol Records building in Hollywood. Plaques were awarded for their efforts to all major members, with Brian Wilson accepting for his late brothers Carl and Dennis.   Personnel changes through the years  From the start, The Beach Boys have undergone many variations in composition, being represented by fill-ins as often as not. Wilson neighbor David Marks appeared on their first four albums and was a member from 1962 to 1963 as a temporary replacement for Jardine, who had left the group to pursue a career in dentistry. Marks rejoined the band in 1997, during Carl Wilson's last illness, and remained with them for two years.  Glen Campbell toured for several months with the group in 1965, as a touring replacement for Brian, who had played bass in concert. Campbell was subsequently replaced by Bruce Johnston, who later became a permanent member. During the mid-1970s drummer Ricky Fataar and guitarist Blondie Chaplin joined the band.  Though not official members, The Beach Boys' supporting band has featured many notable musicians over the years. Keyboard player Daryl Dragon, later famous as half of the pop duo Captain & Tennille, toured with the band, along with his future wife Toni Tennille. Carli Muñoz, who had been playing percussion with the band since 1970, in 1971 replaced Daryl Dragon as keyboard player until 1981. Jeff Foskett joined the touring band in 1981 as a guitarist and vocalist and remained with the group until 1990, Foskett is currently a member of Brian Wilson's group. Billy Hinsche, of Dino, Desi, & Billy fame, was also a longtime member of the supporting band throughout the '70s, '80s, and '90s. Daryl Dragon's brother Dennis Dragon was a percussionist for the group in the early '70s. Bobby Figueroa was a drummer and percussionist for the Beach Boys in the 1970s and 80s. Mike Meros was a longtime keyboard player for the group, leaving in 2001 to join Alan Jardine's Endless Summer Band (Meros passed away in late 2007). Mike Kowalski was a longtime drummer for the band, starting his Beach Boys tenure in 1969, and continuing with the group throughout the '70s, '80s,' 90s, and '00s, only to leave in 2007. Ed Carter played guitar and bass for the group from 1969 through the late 1990s. Carter joined Al Jardine's Beach Boys Friends and Family in 1999.  Some of the changes in The Beach Boys' organization were less formal. They enjoyed a casual collaboration with fellow Southern Californians Jan And Dean. Much to the consternation of other band members, Wilson composed ""Surf City"" and gave the song, without compensation, to Dean Torrence. Jan and Dean, at the time not nearly as popular as The Beach Boys, recorded the song and scored their first number one single, long before the Beach Boys reached the same milestone. Years later, Torrence happened upon the studio where the Beach Boys were recording their ""Beach Boys' Party!"" album. He joined in the singing, and can be heard singing harmony in the ""Barbara Ann"" cut from that album.  After the death of Carl Wilson, Mike Love received permission from Brian Wilson, Al Jardine, and the estate of Carl Wilson to tour under the Beach Boys name. In 1998 and 1999, Mike Love, Bruce Johnston, and David Marks toured under this incarnation of the Beach Boys. In 1999, David Marks left so he could focus on fighting his Hepatitis C (He was fully cured in 2004.). From 1999 to 2011, Mike Love and Bruce Johnston have played up to 100 shows a year, sometimes more, under the Beach Boys banner.  To the surprise and delight of fans around the world, Brian Wilson has mounted several major tours under his own name with a band containing members of The Wondermints (Darian Sahanaja, Nick Walusko, and Probyn Gregory) and led by former Beach Boys guitarist Jeff Foskett plus other supporting musicians (Scott Bennett, Taylor Mills, Jim Hines, Paul Mertens, Nelson Bragg, Bob Lizik). Their note-perfect live performances of the entire Pet Sounds album earned some of the most glowing concert reviews of Wilson's career, with some commentators calling the shows ""the concert of a lifetime"". In 2003 and 2004, he and Van Dyke Parks reunited to complete the unfinished sections of Smile, and in 2004 Wilson and his band toured the world performing a live concert version of the album. They then recorded a new studio version of Smile using vintage recording equipment and including sessions at the fabled Sunset Sound Studios in Hollywood, where some of the original recordings were made.  In September of 2007, Wilson debuted a new work entitled That Lucky Old Sun, co-written with Van Dyke Parks and band member Scott Bennett, at the Royal Festival Hall in London. Wilson plans to record and release That Lucky Old Sun as a studio album in 2008.  Jardine toured for a while with the Beach Boys Family & Friends (which for legal reasons quickly became Alan Jardine Family & Friends Beach Band), featuring his sons Matt and Adam, Wilson's daughters Carnie and Wendy, former Beach Boys sidemen Ed Carter , Bobby Figueroa, and Carl's brother-in-law Billy Hinsche, among others. Jardine now tours as the Endless Summer Band which includes his two sons, Hinsche, and several other performers including members of the pop/rock band Tripsitter.  50th Anniversary  In December 2011, surviving members Brian Wilson, Mike Love, Al Jardine, David Marks, and Bruce Johnston reunited for a new studio album and an extensive 70-plus date ""50th Anniversary Celebration"" world tour. They used musicians from both Brian Wilson's solo band and Mike Love's touring ""Beach Boys"" as sidemen. The reunited Beach Boys played to enthusiastic crowds all over the world.   In 2012 Mike Love announced that he and Bruce Johnston had booked shows for their scaled down version of the Beach Boys. Wilson, Jardine, and Marks wanted to continue with the reunited line up, but for various reasons, Love did not.   In 2013, Mike Love and Bruce Johnston are continuing to tour under the Beach Boys name. Brian Wilson has been in the studio, it is not known whether the sessions are for the Beach Boys, or for Brian solo material. Brian Wilson also plans to play two shows with Al Jardine and David Marks, one show in Ohio, and the other at the Greek Theater in Los Angeles. A live album and/or DVD, and a career-spanning box set entitled ""Made In California"" are slated to be released sometime in 2013.

The group's original lineup consisted of brothers Brian, Dennis and Carl Wilson, their cousin Mike Love, and their friend Al Jardine. Emerging at the vanguard of the ""California Sound"", the band's early music gained international popularity for their distinct vocal harmonies and lyrics evoking a southern California youth culture of surfing, cars, and romance. Influenced by jazz-based vocal groups, 1950s rock and roll, and doo-wop, Brian led the band to experiment with several genres ranging from pop ballads to psychedelic and baroque while devising novel approaches to music production and arranging. While initially managed by the Wilsons' father Murry, Brian's creative ambitions and sophisticated songwriting abilities dominated the group's musical direction. 
Released in 1966, the Pet Sounds album and the ""Good Vibrations"" single featured an intricate and multi-layered sound that represented a departure from the simple surf rock of the Beach Boys' early years. Soon after the dissolution of Smile, Brian gradually ceded control to the rest of the band, reducing his input due to mental health and substance abuse issues. Though the more democratic incarnation of the Beach Boys recorded a string of albums in various musical styles that garnered international critical success, the group struggled to reclaim their commercial momentum in America. Since the 1980s, much-publicized legal wrangling over royalties, songwriting credits and use of the band's name transpired. Dennis drowned in 1983 and Carl died of lung cancer in 1998. After Carl's death, many live configurations of the band fronted by Mike Love and Bruce Johnston continued to tour into the 2000s while other members pursued solo projects. For the band's 50th anniversary, the surviving co-founders briefly reunited for a new studio album and world tour. 
The Beach Boys are often touted ""America's Band"", and AllMusic stated that their ""unerring ability...made them America's first, best rock band."" The group had over eighty songs chart worldwide, thirty-six of them United States Top 40 hits (the most by an American rock band), four reaching number-one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The Beach Boys have sold in excess of 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling bands of all time and are listed at number 12 on Rolling Stone magazine's 2004 list of the ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"". They have received one Grammy Award for The Smile Sessions (2011). The core quintet of the three Wilsons, Love and Jardine were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988. 

1958-66: Brian Wilson era:

Formation:

At the time of his sixteenth birthday on June 20, 1958, Brian Wilson shared a bedroom with his brothers, Dennis and Carl - aged thirteen and eleven, respectively - in their family home in Hawthorne. He had watched his father, Murry Wilson, play piano, and had listened intently to the harmonies of vocal groups such as the Four Freshmen. After dissecting songs such as ""Ivory Tower"" and ""Good News"", Brian would teach family members how to sing the background harmonies. For his birthday that year, Brian was given a reel-to-reel tape recorder. He learned how to overdub, using his vocals and those of Carl and their mother. Brian would play piano with Carl and David Marks, an eleven-year-old longtime neighbor, playing the guitars they had each received as Christmas presents. 
Soon Brian and Carl were avidly listening to Johnny Otis' KFOX radio show. Inspired by the simple structure and vocals of the rhythm and blues songs he heard, Brian changed his piano-playing style and started writing songs. His enthusiasm interfered with his music studies at school. Family gatherings brought the Wilsons in contact with cousin Mike Love. Brian taught Love's sister Maureen and a friend harmonies. Later, Brian, Mike Love and two friends performed at Hawthorne High School. Brian also knew Al Jardine, a high school classmate who had already played guitar in a folk group called the Islanders. Brian suggested to Jardine that they team up with his cousin and brother Carl. 
It was at these sessions, held in Brian's bedroom, that ""the Beach Boys sound"" began to form. Love encouraged Brian to write songs and gave the fledgling band its name: ""The Pendletones"", a portmanteau of ""Pendleton"", a style of woolen shirt popular at the time and ""tone"", the musical term. Although surfing motifs were very prominent in their early songs, Dennis was the only avid surfer in the group. He suggested that the group compose songs celebrating the sport and the lifestyle which had developed around it within Southern California. 

Jardine and a singer friend, Gary Winfrey, went to Brian to see if he could help out with a version of a folk song they wanted to record--""Sloop John B"". In Brian's absence, the two spoke with their father, a music industry veteran of modest success. Murry arranged for the Pendletones to meet his publisher, Hite Morgan. The group performed a slower ballad, ""Their Hearts Were Full of Spring"", but failed to impress Morgan. After an awkward pause, Dennis mentioned they had an original song, ""Surfin'"". Brian finished the song, and together with Mike Love, wrote ""Surfin' Safari"". The group rented guitars, drums, amplifiers and microphones, and practiced for three days while the Wilsons' parents were on a short vacation. 
In October 1961, the Pendletones recorded the two surfing song demos in twelve takes at Keen Recording Studio. Murry brought the demos to Herb Newman, owner of Candix Records and Era Records, and he signed the group on December 8, 1961. When the boys eagerly unpacked the first box of singles - released both under the Candix label, and also as a promo issue under X Records (Morgan's label) - they were shocked to see their band had been renamed as the Beach Boys. Murry Wilson called Morgan and learned that Candix wanted to name the group the Surfers to directly associate them with the increasingly popular teen sport. But Russ Regan, a young promoter with Era Records - who later became president of 20th Century Fox Records - noted that there already existed a group by that name, and he suggested calling them the Beach Boys. 

Beach-themed period:

Released in December 1961, ""Surfin'"" was soon aired on KFWB and KRLA, two of Los Angeles' most influential teen radio stations. It was a hit on the West Coast, going to number three in Southern California, and peaked at number 75 on the national pop charts. By the final weeks of 1961 ""Surfin'"" had sold more than 40,000 copies. By now the de facto manager of the Beach Boys, he landed the group's first paying gig (for which they earned $300) on New Year's Eve, 1961, at the Ritchie Valens Memorial Dance in Long Beach, headlined by Ike & Tina Turner. In their earliest public appearances, the band wore heavy wool jacket-like shirts which were favored by local surfers before switching to their trademark striped shirts and white pants 
Although Murry effectively seized managerial control of the band, Brian acknowledged that he ""deserves credit for getting us off the ground... he hounded us mercilessly... but also worked hard himself"". In the first half of February 1962, Jardine left the band and was replaced by Marks. The band recorded two more originals on April 19 at Western Studios, Los Angeles; ""Lonely Sea"" and ""409"", also re-recording ""Surfin' Safari"". On June 4, the band released their second single ""Surfin' Safari"" backed with ""409"". The release prompted national coverage in the June 9 issue of Billboard where the magazine praised Love's lead vocal and deemed the song to have strong hit potential. After being turned down by Dot and Liberty, the Beach Boys eventually signed a seven-year contract with Capitol Records on July 16 based on the strength of the June demo session. This was at the urging of Capitol exec Nik Venet who signed the group, finding them to be the ""teenage gold"" he had been scouting. By November, their first album was ready--Surfin' Safari which reached 32 on the US Billboard charts. Their song output continued along the same commercial line, focusing on California youth lifestyle. 
In January 1963, three months after the release of their debut album, the band began recording their sophomore effort, Surfin' U.S.A., a breakthrough for Brian, who began asserting himself as songwriter and arranger. The LP was the start of Brian's penchant for doubletracking vocals, a pioneering innovation which provided the Beach Boys with an exceptionally bright sound. Released on March 25, 1963, Surfin' U.S.A., met a more enthusiastic reception, reaching number two on the Billboard charts, propelling the band into a nationwide spotlight, and was vital to launching surf music as a national craze. Five days prior to the release of Surfin' U.S.A., Brian produced ""Surf City"", a song he had written for Jan and Dean. ""Surf City"" hit number one on the Billboard charts in July 1963, a development that pleased Brian but angered Murry, who felt his son had ""given away"" what should have been the Beach Boys' first chart-topper. 
At the beginning of a tour of the Mid-West in April 1963, Jardine rejoined the Beach Boys at Brian's request. As he began playing live gigs again, Brian left the road to focus on writing and recording. The result of this arrangement produced the albums Surfer Girl, released on September 16, 1963 and Little Deuce Coupe, released less than a month later on October 7, 1963. This sextet incarnation of the Beach Boys did not extend beyond these two albums, as Marks officially left the band in early October due to conflict with manager Murry, pulling Brian back into touring. 
Around this time, Brian began using members of the Wrecking Crew to augment his increasingly demanding studio arrangements. Session musicians that participated on Wilson's productions were said to have been awestruck by his musical abilities, as drummer Hal Blaine explained, ""We all studied in conservatories; we were trained musicians. We thought it was a fluke at first, but then we realized Brian was writing these incredible songs. This was not just a young kid writing about high school and surfing."" For composer Frank Zappa, the most exciting thing to him in ""white-person-music"" was when the Beach Boys used the progression V-II on ""Little Deuce Coupe"", calling it ""an important step forward by going backward."" A standalone Christmas-themed single, ""Little Saint Nick"", was released in December 1963, backed with an a capella rendition of the scriptural song ""The Lord's Prayer"". The A-side peaked at number 3 on the US Billboard Christmas chart. 
Following a successful Australasian tour in January and February 1964, the band returned home to face the British Invasion through the Beatles appearances on the Ed Sullivan Show. Signed to the same label as the Beach Boys, Capitol immediately began waning their support for the group, causing Murry to fight proactively for the band at the label more than before, often showing up to their offices in person without a call in advance in order to ""twist executive arms"". Brian reacted to the Beatles with pronounced bemusement: ""I was flipping out. I couldn't understand how a group could be just yelled and screamed at. The music they made, 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' for example, wasn't even that great a record, but they just screamed at it. ... It got us off our asses in the studio. We started cutting - we said 'look, don't worry about the Beatles, we'll cut our own stuff."" Reportedly, Brian wanted more time to complete their next album, yet Capitol insisted they finish recording swiftly to avoid being forgotten in the throes of the impending invasion. Satisfying these demands, the band hastily finished the sessions on February 20, 1964 and titled the album Shut Down Volume 2. ""Fun, Fun, Fun"" was released as a single from the album (backed with ""Why Do Fools Fall in Love"") and was a major hit. The LP, while containing several filler tracks, was propelled by other songs such as the melancholic ""The Warmth of the Sun"" and the advanced production style of ""Don't Worry Baby"". 
Brian soon wrote his last surf song in April 1964. That month, during recording of the single ""I Get Around"", Murry was relieved of his duties as manager. Brian reflected, ""We love the family thing - y'know: three brothers, a cousin and a friend is a really beautiful way to have a group - but the extra generation can become a hang-up"". When the single was released in May of that year, it would climb to number one, their first single to do so. Two months later, the album that the song later appeared on, All Summer Long, reached number four on the Billboard 200 charts. All Summer Long introduced exotic textures to the Beach Boys' sound exemplified by the piccolos and xylophones of its title track. The album was a swan-song to the surf and car music the Beach Boys built their commercial standing upon. Later albums took a different stylistic and lyrical path. Before this, a live album, Beach Boys Concert, was released in October to a four-week chart stay at number one, containing a setlist of previously recorded hits and covers that they hadn't yet recorded. 

Today! and Summer Days:
In June 1964, Brian began recording the bulk of The Beach Boys' Christmas Album with a forty-one-piece studio orchestra in collaboration with Four Freshmen arranger Dick Reynolds. Released in December, it was divided between five new, original Christmas-themed songs and seven reinterpretations of traditional Christmas songs. One single from the album, ""The Man with All the Toys"", was released, peaking at number 6 on the US Billboard Christmas chart. On October 29, the Beach Boys performed for The T.A.M.I. Show, a concert film intended to bring together a wide range of hit-making musicians for a one-off performance. The result was released to movie theaters one month later. 
By the end of the year, the stress of road travel, composing, producing and maintaining a high level of creativity became too much for Brian. On December 23, while on a flight from Los Angeles to Houston, he suffered a panic attack only hours after performing with the Beach Boys on the musical variety series Shindig!. In January 1965, he announced his withdrawal from touring to concentrate entirely on songwriting and record production. For the rest of 1964 and into 1965, Glen Campbell served as Wilson's temporary replacement in concert, until his own career success pulled him from the group in April 1965. Bruce Johnston was asked to locate a replacement for Campbell; having failed to find one, Johnston himself became a full-time member of the band on May 19, 1965, first replacing Brian on the road and later contributing in the studio, beginning with the vocal sessions for ""California Girls"" on June 4, 1965. 

After Brian relinquished touring in 1965, he became a full-time studio artist, showcasing a great leap forward with The Beach Boys Today!, an album containing a suite-like structure divided by songs and ballads which portended the Album Era with its cohesive artistic statement. During the recording sessions for Today!, Love told Melody Maker that he and the band wanted to look beyond surf rock and to avoid living in the past or resting on their laurels. The resulting LP had largely guitar-oriented pop songs such as ""Dance, Dance, Dance"" and ""Good to My Baby"" on side A with B-side ballads such as ""Please Let Me Wonder"" and ""She Knows Me Too Well"". 
Today! marked a maturation in the Beach Boys' lyric content by abandoning themes related to surfing, cars, or teenage love. Some love songs remained, but with a marked increase in depth, along with introspective tracks accompanied by adventurous and distinct arrangements. While the band's contemporaries grew more intellectually aware, Capitol continued to bill them as ""America's Top Surfin' Group!"", expecting Brian to write more surfing material for the yearly summer markets despite his disinterest. 
In June 1965, the band released Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!). The album included a reworked arrangement of ""Help Me, Rhonda"" which had become the band's second number one single in the spring of 1965, displacing the Beatles' ""Ticket to Ride"". ""Let Him Run Wild"" tapped into the youthful angst that would later pervade their music. In November 1965, the group followed up their US number-three-charting ""California Girls"" from Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!) with another top-twenty single, ""The Little Girl I Once Knew"". It was considered the band's most experimental statement thus far, using silence as a pre-chorus, clashing keyboards, moody brass and vocal tics. The single continued Brian's ambitions for daring arrangements, featuring unexpected tempo changes and numerous false endings. Perhaps too extreme an arrangement to go much higher than its number 20 peak, it was the band's second single not to reach the top ten since their 1962 breakthrough. 
Capitol demanded a Beach Boys LP for the 1965 Christmas season, and to appease them, Brian conceived Beach Boys' Party!, a live-in-the-studio album consisting mostly of acoustic covers of 1950s rock and R&B songs, in addition to covers of three Beatles songs, Bob Dylan's ""The Times They Are a-Changin'"", and idiosyncratic rerecordings of the group's earlier hits. In December they scored an unexpected number two hit (number three in the UK) with ""Barbara Ann"", which Capitol released as a single with no band input. Originally by the Regents, it became one of the Beach Boys' most recognized hits. 

Pet Sounds:

In 1966, the Beach Boys formally established their use of unconventional instruments and elaborate layers of vocal harmonies on their groundbreaking record Pet Sounds. It is considered Brian's most concise demonstration of his production and songwriting expertise. With songs such as ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"" and ""Sloop John B"", the album's innovative soundscape incorporates elements of pop, jazz, classical, exotica, and the avant-garde. The instrumentation combines found sounds such as bicycle bells and dog whistles with classically inspired orchestrations and the usual rock set-up of drums and guitars; among others, silverware, accordions, plucked piano strings, barking dogs, and plastic water jugs. For the basic rhythmic feel for ""God Only Knows"", harpsichord, piano with slapback echo, sleigh bells, and strings spilled into each other to create a rich blanket of sound. 
Pet Sounds is considered by some as a Brian Wilson solo album in all but name, as other members contributed relatively little to the compositions or recordings. Influenced by psychedelic drugs, Brian turned inward and probed his deep-seated self-doubts and emotional longings; the piece did not address the problems in the world around them, unlike other psychedelic rock groups. As Jim Miller wrote of the album's tone, ""It vented Wilson's obsession with isolation cataloging a forlorn quest for security. The whole enterprise, which smacked of song cycle pretensions, was streaked with regret and romantic langour."" According to Brian, the album was designed as a collection of art pieces which belong together yet could stand alone. 
Released in May, Pet Sounds eventually peaked at number eleven in the US and number two in the UK, an accomplishment which helped the Beach Boys become the strongest selling album act in the UK for the final quarter of 1966, dethroning the three-year reign of native bands such as the Beatles. Met with a lukewarm critical reception in the US,Pet Sounds was indifferently promoted by Capitol and failed to become the major hit Wilson had hoped it would be. Its failure to gain a wider recognition in the US combined with Capitol's decision to issue Best of The Beach Boys in July dispirited Brian, who considered Pet Sounds an extremely personal work. It was assumed that the label considered the album a risk, appealing more to an older demographic than the younger, female audience the Beach Boys built their commercial standing on.Pet Sounds sales numbered approximately 500,000 units, a significant drop-off from the chain of million-selling albums which immediately preceded it.Best of The Beach Boys was quickly certified Gold by the RIAA. 
In a 1972 review of Pet Sounds, music journalist Stephen Davis wrote, 

From first cut to last we were treated to an intense, linear personal vision of the vagaries of a love affair and the painful, introverted anxieties that are the wrenching precipitates of the unstable chemistry of any love relationship. This trenchant cycle of love songs has the emotional impact of a shatteringly evocative novel, and by God if this little record didn't change only the course of popular music, but the course of a few lives in the bargain. ... nobody was prepared for anything so soulful, so lovely, something one had to think about so much. 

Pet Sounds went on to be acknowledged as an important historical and cultural work, remaining today as an evocative release with distinctive lushness and melancholy. Beyond pop and rock, Pet Sounds expanded the field of music production. It was massively influential upon its release, vaunting the band to the top level of rock innovators. It is one of the earliest rock concept albums, one of the earliest concept albums of the counterculture era, and an early album in the emerging psychedelic rock style, signaling a turning point wherein rock, which previously had been considered dance music, became music that was made for listening to. 
In The Album: A Guide to Pop Music's Most Provocative, Influential, and Important Creations, author James Perone championed the album for its complex orchestrations, sophisticated compositions, and varied tone colors, calling it a remove from ""just about anything else that was going on in 1966 pop music."" In 1976, journalist Robin Denselow wrote: ""With the 1966 Pet Sounds album ... Wilson had become America's equivalent of the Beatles with his ability to expand the limits of popular taste.""Paul McCartney named it one of his favorite albums of all time on multiple occasions, calling it the primary impetus for the Beatles' album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967). In 2003, Pet Sounds was ranked second in ""The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time"" list selected by Rolling Stone, behind only Sgt. Pepper. 

""Good Vibrations"" and Smile:
Seeking to expand on Pet Sounds' advances, Wilson began an even more ambitious project: ""Good Vibrations"". Like Pet Sounds, Brian opted for an eclectic array of instruments rarely heard in pop music. Described by Brian as a ""pocket symphony,"" it contains a mixture of classical, rock, and exotic instruments structured around a cut-up mosaic of musical sections represented by several discordant key and modal shifts. It became the Beach Boys' biggest hit to date, and a US and UK number one single in 1966. Coming at a time when pop singles were usually made in under two hours, it was one of the most complex pop productions ever undertaken, and the most expensive single ever recorded to that point. The production costs were estimated between $50,000 and $75,000 ($360,000 and $550,000 today) with sessions for the song stretching over several months in at least four major studios. According to Domenic Priore, the making of ""Good Vibrations"" was unlike anything previous in the realms of classical, jazz, international, soundtrack, or any other kind of recording. 
The single was an unequivocal milestone in studio productions, and continued in establishing Brian as an extender of popular tastes. To the counterculture of the 1960s, ""Good Vibrations"" served as an anthem. Rock critic Gene Sculatti prophesied in 1968, ""It may yet prove to be the most significantly revolutionary piece of the current rock renaissance."" Its instrumentation included the Tannerin, an easier-to-manipulate version of a theremin, which helped the Beach Boys claim a new hippie audience. Upon release, the single prompted an unexpected revival in theremins while increasing awareness of analog synthesizers, leading Moog Music to produce their own brand of ribbon-controlled instruments. Reflecting on this period in 1971, Cue magazine wrote: ""In the year and a half that followed Pet Sounds, the Beach Boys were among the vanguard in practically every aspect of the counter culture - psychedelia, art rock, a return to roots, ecology, organic food, the cooled-out sound - anticipating changes that rock didn't accomplish until 1969-1970."" 
The group established a short-lived film production company, called Home Movies, during this time. It was supposed to have created live action film and television properties starring the Beach Boys. However, the company completed only one music video, for ""Good Vibrations"", though various other psychedelic sequences and segments exist. 

I'm doing the spiritual sound, a white spiritual sound. Religious music...That's the whole movement...That's where I'm going and it's going to scare a lot of people when I get there. 

--Brian Wilson quoted in Goodbye Surfing, Hello God! (1967), by Jules Siegel

Brian met musician and songwriter Van Dyke Parks while working on Pet Sounds. A year later, while in the midst of recording ""Good Vibrations"", the duo began an intense collaboration that resulted in a suite of challenging new songs for the Beach Boys‍ '​ forthcoming album Smile, intended to surpass Pet Sounds. Recording for the album spanned about a year, from 1966 to 1967. It is known that Wilson and Parks intended Smile to be a continuous suite of songs that were linked both thematically and musically, with the main songs being linked together by small vocal pieces and instrumental segments that elaborated upon the musical themes of the major songs. Surviving recordings have shown that the music incorporated chanting, cowboy songs, explorations in Indian and Hawaiian music, jazz, tone poems with classical elements, cartoon sound effects, musique concrète, and yodeling. 
Parks has stated: he and Brian were conscious of the counterculture, and the two had felt estranged from it, but it was necessary to adhere to due to a willingness to ""get out of the Eisenhower mindset."" Parks stresses, ""At the same time, he didn't want to lose that kind of gauche sensibility that he had. He was doing stuff that nobody would dream of doing,"" citing an instance when Brian instructed a banjo player to play only one string, a ""gauche"" style of playing that ""just wasn't done"". 
Smile would go on to become the most legendary unreleased album in the history of popular music. In the decades following its non-release, it became the subject of intense speculation and mystique. Many believe that, had the album been released, it would have substantially altered the group's direction and established them at the vanguard of rock innovators. Writing about the album for the 33⅓ book series, Luis Sanchez stated: ""If Brian Wilson and The Beach Boys were going to survive as the defining force of American pop music they were, Smile was a conscious attempt to rediscover the impulses and ideas that power American consciousness from the inside out. It was a collaboration that led to some incredible music, which, if it had been completed as an album and delivered to the public in 1966, might have had an incredible impact."" 
Many factors combined to put intense pressure on Brian Wilson as Smile neared completion: his mental instability, the pressure to create despite fierce internal opposition to his new music, the relatively unenthusiastic response to Pet Sounds in the United States, Carl Wilson's draft resistance, and a major dispute with Capitol Records. Furthermore, Wilson's reliance on both prescription drugs and amphetamines exacerbated his underlying mental health problems. Comparable to Brian Jones and Syd Barrett, Brian Wilson's use of psychedelic drugs--especially LSD--led to a nervous breakdown in the late-1960s. As his legend grew, the Smile period came to be seen as the pivotal episode in his decline, and he became tagged as one of the most notorious celebrity drug casualties of the rock era. 

1967-77: the Beach Boys as a democratic unit:

Smiley Smile and Wild Honey:
Some Smile tracks were salvaged and re-recorded in scaled-down versions at Brian's new home studio. Along with the single version of ""Good Vibrations"", these tracks were released on Smiley Smile, an album which elicited positive critical and commercial response abroad, but was the first real commercial failure for the group in the United States. By this time the Beach Boys' management (Nick Grillo and David Anderle) had created the band's own record label, Brother. One of the first labels to be owned by a rock group, Brother Records was intended for releases of Beach Boys side projects, and as an invitation to new talent. The initial output of the label, however, was limited to Smiley Smile and two resulting singles from the album; the failure of ""Gettin' Hungry"" caused the band to shelve Brother until 1970. Despite the cancellation of Smile, several tracks--including ""Our Prayer"", ""Cabin Essence"" and ""Surf's Up""--continued to trickle out in later albums often as filler songs to offset Brian's unwillingness to contribute. The band was still expecting to complete and release Smile as late as 1973 before it became clear that only Brian could comprehend the endless fragments that had been recorded.Smiley Smile was followed up three months later with Wild Honey, featuring songs written by Wilson and Love, including the hit ""Darlin'"" and a rendition of Stevie Wonder's ""I Was Made to Love Her"". The album fared better than its predecessor, reaching number 24 in the US. 

By 1967, the Beach Boys had become cultural dinosaurs. And it happened almost overnight....Monterey was a gathering place for the ""far out"" sounds of the ""new"" rock, and the Beach Boys in concert really had no exotic sounds to display. The net result of all their internal and external turmoil was that the Beach Boys didn't go...and it is thought that this non-appearance was what really turned the ""underground"" tide against them. 

--David Leaf

Compounding the group's recent setbacks, their public image took a cataclysmic hit following their withdrawal from the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival for the reason that they had no new material to play while their forthcoming single and album lay in limbo. Their cancellation was seen as ""a damning admission that they were washed up and unable to compete with the 'new music'"". This notion was exacerbated by Rolling Stone writer Jann Wenner, who in contemporary publications criticized Brian Wilson for his oft-repeated ""genius"" label which he called a ""promotional shuck"" and an attempt to compare with the Beatles. However, Wenner later responded to their Wild Honey album with more optimism, remarking two months later that ""in any case it's good to see that the Beach Boys are getting their heads straight once again"". 
While being interviewed in August 1967 for the failed live album Lei'd in Hawaii, Brian admitted: ""I think rock n' roll-the pop scene-is happening. It's great. But I think basically, the Beach Boys are squares. We're not happening."" Former band publicist Derek Taylor later recalled a conversation with Brian and Dennis where they denied that the group had ever written surf music or songs about cars, and that the Beach Boys had never been involved with the surf and hot rod fads, as Taylor claimed, ""...they would not concede."" As a result of their initial target demographic and subsequent failures to blend with the hippie movement, the group was viewed as unhip relics, even though they had once been, as biographer Peter Ames Carlin wrote, ""the absolute center of the American rock 'n' roll scene,"" a time when they had ushered the psychedelic era. In early 1969, Brian proposed that the group change their name from ""the Beach Boys"" to ""the Beach"", reasoning for the simple fact that the band members were now grown men. Going to the effort of acquiring a contract which would declare a five-way agreement to officially rename the group, Stephen Desper reported, ""They all just kind of shrugged and said, 'Aw, come on, Brian, we don't wanna do that. That's how the public knows us, man. And that was it. He put the paper on the piano and it stayed there until I picked it up and took it away."" 

Friends and 20/20:

After meeting Maharishi Mahesh Yogi at a UNICEF Variety Gala in Paris, France on December 15, 1967, Love, along with other high-profile celebrities such as Donovan and the Beatles traveled to Rishikesh in India during February and March 1968. The following Beach Boys album Friends (1968) had songs influenced by the Transcendental Meditation taught by the Maharishi. The album reached number 13 in the UK and 126 in the US, the title track placing at number 25 in the UK and number 47 in the US, the band's lowest singles peak since 1962. In support of the Friends album, Love had arranged for the Beach Boys to tour with the Maharishi in the US, which has been called ""one of the more bizarre entertainments of the era"". Starting on May 3, 1968, the tour lasted five shows and was cancelled when the Maharishi had to withdraw to fulfill film contracts. Due to disappointing audience numbers and the Maharishi's withdrawal, twenty-four tour dates were subsequently cancelled at a cost estimated at US$250,000 (approximately US$1,610,000 today) for the band. This tour was followed by the release of ""Do It Again"", a single which critics described as an update of the Beach Boys' surf rock past in a late-1960's style. The single went to the top of the Australian and UK single charts in 1968 and was moderately successful in the US, peaking at number 20. 
For a short time in mid-1968, Brian Wilson sought psychological treatment in hospital. During his absence, other members began writing and producing material themselves. To complete their contract with Capitol, they produced one more album. 20/20 (1969) was one of the group's most stylistically diverse albums, including hard rock songs such as ""All I Want to Do"", the waltz-based ""Time to Get Alone"" and a remake of the Ronettes' ""I Can Hear Music"". The diversity of genres have been described as an indicator that the group was trying to establish an updated identity. The album performed strongly in the UK, reaching number three on the charts. In the US, the album reached a modest 68. 
In spring 1968, Dennis began a strained relationship with musician Charles Manson which persisted for several months afterward. Dennis bought him time at Brian's home studio where recording sessions were attempted while Brian stayed in his room. It was then proposed by Dennis that Manson be signed to Brother Records, though Brian reportedly disliked Charlie, and so a deal was never made. Without Manson's involvement, the Beach Boys did record one song penned by Manson: ""Cease to Exist"" rewritten as ""Never Learn Not To Love"". The idea of the Beach Boys recording one of his songs reportedly thrilled Manson, and it was released as a Beach Boys single. After accruing a large monetary debt to the group, Dennis deliberately omitted Manson's credit on its release while also altering the song's arrangement and lyrics. This greatly angered Manson. Growing fearful, Dennis gradually distanced himself from Manson, whose family had taken over his home. He was eventually convicted for murder conspiracy; from there on, Dennis was too afraid of the Manson family to ever speak publicly on his relationship, let alone testify against him. 
On April 12, 1969, the band revisited their 1967 lawsuit against Capitol Records after they alleged an audit undertaken revealed the band were owed over US$2,000,000 (US$12,860,000 today) for unpaid royalties and production duties. The band's contract with Capitol Records expired on June 30, 1969, after which Capitol Records deleted the Beach Boys' catalog from print, effectively cutting off their royalty flow. In November 1969, Murry Wilson sold Sea of Tunes, the Beach Boys' catalogue, to Irving Almo Music, a decision which according to Marilyn Wilson ""devastated Brian"". In late 1969, the Beach Boys reactivated their Brother label and signed with Reprise. Around this time, the band commenced recording for a new album. At the time the Beach Boys tenure ended with Capitol in 1969, they had sold 65 million records worldwide, closing the decade as the most commercially successful American group in popular music. 

Sunflower, Surf's Up, ""So Tough"", and Holland:

In 1970, armed with the new Reprise contract, the band appeared rejuvenated, releasing the album Sunflower to critical acclaim in the UK but indifference in the US. The album features a strong group presence with significant writing contributions from all band members. Brian was active during this period, writing or co-writing seven of the twelve songs on Sunflower and performing at half of the band's domestic concerts in 1970. Sunflower reached number 29 in the UK and number 151 in the US, the band's lowest domestic chart showing to that point. A version of ""Cottonfields"" arranged by Al Jardine appeared on European releases of Sunflower and as a single, reached number one in Australia, Norway, South Africa and Sweden and the top-five in six other countries, including the UK. 
After Sunflower, the band hired Jack Rieley as their manager. Under Rieley's management, the group's music began emphasizing political and social awareness. During this time, Carl Wilson gradually assumed leadership of the band and Rieley contributed lyrics. On August 30, 1971 the band released Surf's Up, named after the Brian Wilson/Van Dyke Parks composition ""Surf's Up"". The album was moderately successful, reaching the US top 30, a marked improvement over their recent releases. While the record charted, the Beach Boys added to their renewed fame by performing a near-sellout set at Carnegie Hall, followed by an appearance with the Grateful Dead at Fillmore East on April 27, 1971. The live shows during this era included reworked arrangements of many of the band's previous songs. A large portion of their set lists culled from Pet Sounds and Smile, as author Domenic Priore observes, ""They basically played what they could have played at the Monterey Pop Festival in the summer of 1967."" 

Johnston ended his first stint with the band shortly after Surf's Up's release, reportedly because of friction with Rieley. At Carl's suggestion, the addition of Ricky Fataar and Blondie Chaplin in February 1972 led to a dramatic restructuring in the band's sound. The album Carl and the Passions - ""So Tough"" was an uncharacteristic mix that included two songs written by Fataar and Chaplin. 
For their next project the band, their families, assorted associates and technicians moved to the Netherlands for the summer of 1972. They rented a farmhouse to convert into a makeshift studio where recording sessions for the new project would take place. By the end of their sessions, the band felt they had produced one of their strongest efforts yet. Reprise, however, felt that the album required a strong single. This resulted in the song ""Sail On, Sailor"", a collaboration between Brian Wilson, Tandyn Almer, Ray Kennedy, Jack Rieley and Van Dyke Parks featuring a soulful lead vocal by Chaplin. Reprise subsequently approved and the resulting album, Holland, was released early in 1973, peaking at number 37. Brian's musical children story, Mount Vernon and Fairway (A Fairy Tale), narrated by Rieley and strongly influenced by Randy Newman's Sail Away (1972), was included as a bonus EP. Despite indifference from Reprise, the band's concert audience started to grow. 
The Beach Boys in Concert, a double album documenting the 1972 and 1973 US tours, was another top-30 album and became the band's first gold record under Reprise. During this period the band established itself as one of America's most popular live acts. Chaplin and Fataar helped organize the concerts to obtain a high quality live performance, playing material off Surf's Up, Carl and the Passions and Holland and adding songs from their older catalog. This concert arrangement lifted them back into American public prominence. In late 1973, the 41-song soundtrack to American Graffiti was released including the band's early songs ""Surfin' Safari"" and ""All Summer Long"". The album was a catalyst in creating a wave of nostalgia that reintroduced the Beach Boys into contemporary American consciousness. In 1974, Capitol Records issued Endless Summer, the band's first major pre-Pet Sounds greatest hits package. The compilation surged to the top of the Billboard album charts and was the group's first multi-million selling record since ""Good Vibrations"". It remained on the charts for two years. Capitol followed with a second compilation, Spirit of America, which also sold well. With these compilations, the Beach Boys became one of the most popular acts in rock, propelling themselves from opening for Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young to headliners selling out basketball arenas in a matter of weeks.Rolling Stone named the Beach Boys the ""Band of the Year"" for 1974, solely on the basis of their juggernaut touring schedule and material written over a decade earlier. 
Rieley, who remained in the Netherlands after Holland‍ '​s release, was relieved of his managerial duties in late 1973. Chaplin also left in late 1973 after an argument with Steve Love, the band's business manager (and Mike's brother). Fataar remained until 1974, when he was offered a chance to join a new group led by future Eagles member Joe Walsh. Chaplin's replacement, James William Guercio, started offering the group career advice that resulted in his becoming their new manager. Under Guercio, the Beach Boys staged a highly successful 1975 joint concert tour with Chicago, with each group performing some of the other's songs, including their previous year's collaboration on Chicago's hit ""Wishing You Were Here"". Beach Boys vocals were also heard on Elton John's 1974 hit ""Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me"". Nostalgia had settled into the Beach Boys' hype; the group had not officially released any new material since 1973's Holland. While their concerts continuously sold out, the stage act slowly changed from a contemporary presentation followed by oldies encores to an entire show made up of mostly pre-1967 music. 

15 Big Ones and Love You:

Recorded in the wake of California Music's demise, a supergroup which would have involved Brian Wilson, Bruce Johnston, and record producer Terry Melcher,15 Big Ones (1976) marked Brian's return as a major force in the group. The album included new songs by Brian, as well as cover versions of oldies such as ""Rock and Roll Music"", ""Blueberry Hill"", and ""In the Still of the Night"". ""Rock and Roll Music"" peaked at number 5 in the US. Brian and Love's ""It's O.K."" was in the vein of their early sixties style and was a moderate hit. The album was publicized by an August 1976 NBC-TV special, simply titled ""The Beach Boys"". The special, produced by Saturday Night Live (SNL) creator Lorne Michaels, featured appearances by SNL cast members John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd. 

The album was generally disliked by fans and critics upon release. During its sessions, Brian's production role was belittled as group members overdubbed and remixed tracks to fight against his desire for a rough, unfinished sound. Carl and Dennis disparaged the album to the press while Brian admitted ""undoubtedly the new album is nothing too deep,"" but remained hopeful that their next release would be on par with the group's ""Good Vibrations"". 
For the remainder of 1976 to early 1977, Brian spent his time making sporadic public appearances and producing the band's next album Love You (1977), a quirky collection of 14 songs mostly written, arranged and produced by Brian. Brian revealed to Peter Ames Carlin that Love You is one of his favorite Beach Boys releases, telling him ""That's when it all happened for me. That's where my heart lies.""Love You peaked at number 28 in the UK and number 53 in the US and developed a cult following; regarded as one of the band's best albums by fans and critics alike, and an early work of synthpop. 

""A diseased bunch of motherfuckers if ever there was one ... But the miracle is that the Beach Boys have made that disease sound like the literal babyflesh pink of health ... Maybe it's just that unprickable and ingenuous wholesomeness that accounts not only for their charm, but for their beauty--a beauty so awesome that listening to them at their best is like being in some vast dream cathedral decorated with a thousand gleaming American pop culture icons."" 

--Lester Bangs in a review of Love You for Circus, June 9, 1977.

Referring to ""naysayers"" of the album, the underground fanzine Scram wrote ""fuck them ... the album showcases a truly original mix of humor and sadness. The original numbers always dance just a step away from the cliché, dealing with simple lyrical themes that make you wonder why they had never been explored before.""The A.V. Club - considering the album to be in ""the same vein"" as Tonight's the Night (1975), Pussy Cats (1974), The Madcap Laughs (1970), and Barrett (1970) - described Love You: ""something almost desperately optimistic ... Wilson sings frayed songs about roller-skating, road-tripping, and Johnny Carson--like a frazzled man sitting in a corner chanting 'calm blue ocean' over and over. It's a beautiful, noisy, funny, heartbreaking work of art--one not for everybody, yet vital for anyone who wants to understand Wilson's overall worldview."" 
After Love You was released, Brian began to record and assemble Adult/Child, an unreleased effort largely consisting of songs written by Wilson from 1976 and 1977 with select big band arrangements by Dick Reynolds. Though publicized as the Beach Boys' next release, Adult/Child caused tension within the group and was ultimately shelved. Following this period, his concert appearances with the band gradually diminished and their performances were occasionally erratic. 
The internal wrangling came to a head after a show at Central Park on September 1, 1977, when the band effectively split into two camps; Dennis and Carl Wilson on one side, Mike Love and Al Jardine on the other with Brian remaining neutral. Following a confrontation on an airport tarmac, Dennis declared to Rolling Stone on September 3 that he had left the band: ""It was Al Jardine who really knifed me in the heart when he said they didn't need me. That was the clincher. And all I told him was that he couldn't play more than four chords. They kept telling me I had my solo album now Pacific Ocean Blue, like I should go off in a corner and leave the Beach Boys to them. The album really bothers them. They don't like to admit it's doing so well; they never even acknowledge it in interviews."" 
The band broke up for two and a half weeks, until a meeting on September 17 at Brian's house. In light of a potential new Caribou Records contract the parties negotiated a settlement resulting in Love gaining control of Brian's vote in the group, allowing Love and Jardine to outvote Carl and Dennis Wilson on any matter. 

1978-present:

Intergroup struggles:
The Beach Boys' last album for Reprise, M.I.U. Album (1978), was recorded at Maharishi International University in Iowa at the suggestion of Love. Dennis and Carl made limited contributions; the album was mostly produced by Jardine and Ron Altbach, with Brian credited as ""executive producer"".M.I.U. was largely a contractual obligation to finish out their association with Reprise, who likewise did not promote the result. The record cemented the divisions in the group. Love and Jardine focused on rock and roll-oriented material while Carl and Dennis chose the progressive focus they had established with the albums Carl and the Passions and Holland. 
Dennis withdrew from the group to focus on his second solo album entitled Bambu. The album was shelved just as alcoholism and marital problems overcame all three Wilson brothers. Carl appeared intoxicated during concerts (especially at appearances for their 1978 Australia tour) and Brian gradually slid back into addiction and an unhealthy lifestyle. 
After departing Reprise, the Beach Boys signed with CBS Records. They received a substantial advance and were paid $1 million per album even as CBS deemed their preliminary review of the band's first product, L.A. (Light Album) as unsatisfactory. Faced with the realization that Brian was unable to contribute, the band recruited Johnston as producer. The result paid off, as ""Good Timin'"" became a top 40 single. The group enjoyed moderate success with a disco reworking of the Wild Honey song ""Here Comes the Night"" which was followed by their highest charting UK single in nine years: Jardine's ""Lady Lynda"" peaked at number 6 in the UK Singles Chart. The album was followed in 1980 by Keepin' the Summer Alive, with Johnston once again producing. Barring an appearance on percussion on the closing track, ""Endless Harmony"", Dennis was absent from this album. 
In 1981, Carl quit the group due to unhappiness with the band's nostalgia format and lackluster live performances, subsequently pursuing a solo career. He returned in May 1982 - after approximately 14 months of being away - on the condition that the group reconsider their rehearsal and touring policies, along with refraining from ""Las Vegas-type engagements"". 

From 1980 through 1982, the Beach Boys and The Grass Roots performed Independence Day concerts at the National Mall in Washington, D.C., attracting large crowds. However, in April 1983, James G. Watt, President Ronald Reagan's Secretary of the Interior, banned Independence Day concerts on the Mall by such groups. Watt said that ""rock bands"" that had performed on the Mall on Independence Day in 1981 and 1982 had encouraged drug use and alcoholism and had attracted ""the wrong element"", who would mug attendees. During the ensuing uproar, which included over 40,000 complaints to the Department of the Interior, the Beach Boys stated that the Soviet Union, which had invited them to perform in Leningrad in 1978, ""obviously ... did not feel that the group attracted the wrong element"". Vice President George H. W. Bush said of the Beach Boys, ""They're my friends and I like their music"". Watt later apologized to the band after learning that President Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan were fans. White House staff presented Watt with a plaster foot with a hole in it, showing that he had ""shot himself in the foot"". The band returned to D.C. for Independence Day in 1984 and performed to a crowd of 750,000 people. 

Deaths of Dennis and Carl:
Dennis' ongoing personal problems kept him out of the group's activities. His alcoholism continued to escalate, and on December 28, 1983, he drowned in Marina del Rey while diving from a friend's boat trying to recover items he had previously thrown overboard in fits of rage. Despite his death, the Beach Boys continued as a successful touring act. 
On July 4, 1985, the Beach Boys played to an afternoon crowd of one million in Philadelphia and the same evening they performed for over 750,000 people on the Mall in Washington (the day's historic achievement was recorded in the Guinness Book of World Records). They also appeared nine days later at the Live Aid concert. That year, they released the eponymous album The Beach Boys and enjoyed a resurgence of interest later in the 1980s, assisted by tributes such as David Lee Roth's hit version of ""California Girls"". ""Getcha Back"", released from the album, gave the group a number 26 single in the US. Following this, the group put out ""Rock 'n' Roll to the Rescue"" (US, number 68) and a cover of the Mamas & the Papas' ""California Dreamin' (US, number 57). In 1987, they played with the rap group The Fat Boys, performing the song ""Wipe Out"" and filming a music video. It was a number 12 single in the US. and a number two rank in the UK. 
By 1988, Brian had drifted from the Beach Boys and released his first solo album, Brian Wilson, which received critical acclaim. During this period the band unexpectedly claimed their first US number one hit single in 22 years with ""Kokomo"", which had appeared in the movie Cocktail, and soon became the band's largest selling single of all time. Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame earlier in the year, the group became the second artist after Aretha Franklin to hit number one in the US after their induction. They released the album Still Cruisin', which went gold in the US and gave them their best chart showing since 1976. In 1990, the band gathered several studio musicians and recorded the Melcher-produced title track of the comedy Problem Child. The album Summer in Paradise, having no new contributions from Brian due to interference from caretaker Eugene Landy, was released two years later to a poor critical reception, and was a commercial disaster. 
A lawsuit was filed by Brian in 1989 to reclaim the rights to his songs and the group's publishing company, Sea of Tunes, which he had supposedly signed away to his father Murry in 1969. He successfully argued that he had not been mentally fit to make an informed decision and that his father had potentially forged his signature. While Wilson failed to regain his copyrights, he was awarded $25 million for unpaid royalties. Soon after Wilson won his case, Love discovered that Murry Wilson had not properly credited him as co-writer on 79 Beach Boys songs. With Love and Brian unable to determine exactly what Love was properly owed, Love sued Brian in 1992, winning $13 million in 1994 for lost royalties. 35 of the group's songs were then amended to credit Love. 
In 1993, the band appeared in Michael Feeney Callan's film The Beach Boys Today, which included in-depth interviews with all members except Brian. Carl confided to Callan that Brian would record again with the band at some point in the near future. A few Beach Boys sessions devoted to new Brian Wilson compositions occurred during the mid-1990s, but they remain largely unreleased, and the album was quickly aborted due to tenuous relations. In February 1996, the Beach Boys guested with Status Quo on a re-recording of ""Fun, Fun, Fun"", which became a British Top-30 hit. In June, the group worked with comedian Jeff Foxworthy on the recording ""Howdy From Maui"", and eventually released Stars and Stripes Vol. 1 in August 1996. The album consisted of country renditions of several Beach Boys hits, performed by popular country artists such as Toby Keith and Willie Nelson. Brian, who was in a better mental state at the time, acted as co-producer. 
In early 1997, Carl was diagnosed with lung cancer and brain cancer after years of heavy smoking. Despite his terminal condition, Carl continued to perform with the band on its 1997 summer tour while undergoing chemotherapy. During performances, he sat on a stool and reportedly needed oxygen after every song. However, Carl was able to stand when he played on ""God Only Knows"". Carl died on February 6, 1998, two months after the death of the Wilsons' mother, Audree. 

Band split and name conflicts:

Following Carl's death, the remaining members splintered. Love, Johnston and former guitarist Marks continued to tour without Jardine, initially as ""America's Band"", but following several cancelled bookings under that name, they sought authorization through Brother Records Inc. (BRI) to tour as ""The Beach Boys"" and secured the necessary license. In turn Jardine began to tour regularly with his band dubbed ""Beach Boys: Family & Friends"" until he ran into legal issues for using the name without license; meanwhile, Jardine sued Love and Brian claiming that he had been excluded from their concerts. BRI, through its longtime attorney, Ed McPherson, sued Jardine in Federal Court. Jardine, in turn, counter-claimed against BRI for wrongful termination. BRI ultimately prevailed after several years. Love was allowed to continue to tour as The Beach Boys, while Jardine was prohibited from touring using any form of the name. 
Released from Landy's control, Brian Wilson sought different treatments for his illnesses that aided him in his solo career. He toured regularly with his backing band consisting of members of Wondermints and other LA/Chicago musicians. Marks also maintained a solo career. Their tours remained reliable draws, with Wilson and Jardine both remaining legal members of the Beach Boys organization and BRI. The surviving group members appeared as themselves for the 1998 documentary film Endless Harmony: The Beach Boys Story, directed by Alan Boyd. Following the success of 1997's The Pet Sounds Sessions, many compilations were then issued by Capitol containing new archival material: Endless Harmony Soundtrack (1998), Ultimate Christmas (1998), and Hawthorne, CA (2001). 
In 2004, Wilson recorded and released his solo album Brian Wilson Presents Smile, a reinterpretation of the Smile project that he initiated with the Beach Boys thirty-six years earlier. That September, Wilson issued a free CD through the Mail On Sunday that included Beach Boys songs he'd recently rerecorded, five of which he'd co-authored with Love. The 10 track compilation had 2.6 million copies distributed and prompted Love to file a lawsuit in November 2005; he claimed the promotion hurt the sales of the original recordings. Love's suit was dismissed in 2007 when a judge determined that there were no triable issues. 
On June 13, 2006, the five surviving Beach Boys (Wilson, Love, Jardine, Johnston, and Marks) appeared together for the celebration of the 40th anniversary of Pet Sounds and the double-platinum certification of their greatest hits compilation, Sounds of Summer: The Very Best of The Beach Boys, in a ceremony atop the Capitol Records building in Hollywood. Plaques were awarded for their efforts, with Wilson accepting on behalf of Dennis and Carl. Throughout the year, it was rumored that the band would reform to perform the Pet Sounds album live in its entirety in November. Ultimately, Wilson began a brief Pet Sounds tour with Jardine and no other group members. 

50th year reunion celebration:

On October 31, 2011, the Beach Boys released surviving 1960s recordings from Smile in the form of The Smile Sessions. The album--even in its incomplete form--garnered universal critical acclaim and experienced popular success, charting in both the Billboard US and UK Top 30. The band was rewarded with glowing reviews, including inclusion in Rolling Stone's Top 500 album list at number 381. The Smile Sessions went on to win Best Historical Album at the 2013 Grammy Awards. Brian Wilson personally accepted the award stating ""I guess Van Dyke and I were on to something after all."" 
In February 2011, the Beach Boys released ""Don't Fight the Sea"", a charity single to aid the victims of the 2011 Japan earthquake. The single, released on Jardine's 2011 album A Postcard From California featured Jardine, Wilson, Love and Johnston, with prerecorded vocals by Carl Wilson. Rumors then circulated regarding a potential 50th anniversary band reunion. 
On December 16, 2011, it was announced that Wilson, Love, Jardine, Johnston and Marks would reunite for a new album and 50th anniversary tour in 2012 to include a performance at the New Orleans Jazz Festival in April 2012. On February 12, 2012, the Beach Boys performed at the 2012 Grammy Awards, in what was billed as a ""special performance"" by organizers. It marked the group's first live performance to include Brian since 1996. The Beach Boys then appeared at the April 10, 2012, season opener for the Los Angeles Dodgers and performed ""Surfer Girl"" along with ""The Star-Spangled Banner"". In April, the new album's title was revealed as That's Why God Made the Radio. The first single from the album, the title track, made its national radio debut April 25, 2012, on ESPN's Mike and Mike in the Morning and was released on iTunes and other digital platforms on April 26.That's Why God Made the Radio debuted at number three on US charts, making US chart history by expanding the group's span of Billboard 200 top ten albums across 49 years and one week, passing the Beatles with 47 years of top ten albums. 
Later in 2012, the group released the Fifty Big Ones and Greatest Hits compilations along with reissues of 12 of their albums. The next year, the group released Live - The 50th Anniversary Tour a 41 song, 2-CD set documenting their 50th Anniversary Tour. While there were no definite plans, Brian stated that he would like to make another Beach Boys album following the world tour. In August 2013, the group released Made in California, a six disc collection featuring more than seven and a half hours of music, including more than 60 previously unreleased tracks, and concluding the Beach Boys' 50th anniversary campaign. That same year, former members of the Beach Boys touring band, Bobby Figueroa, Billy Hinsche, Ed Carter, Matt Jardine (son of Al Jardine), and Philip Bardowell (sometimes with Randell Kirsch and others) united to form California Surf, Incorporated, performing Beach Boy songs. 

Resumed band split:

In June 2012, Love announced additional touring dates which would not feature Wilson. Wilson then denied knowledge of these new dates. On October 5, Love announced in a self-written press release to the LA Times that the band would return to its pre-50th Reunion Tour lineup with him and Johnston touring as the Beach Boys without Wilson, Jardine, and Marks: 

I did not fire Brian Wilson from the Beach Boys. I cannot fire Brian Wilson from the Beach Boys ... I do not have such authority. And even if I did, I would never fire Brian Wilson from the Beach Boys. ... This tour was always envisioned as a limited run ... As the year went on, Brian and Al wanted to keep the 50th anniversary tour going beyond the 75 dates ... However ... we had already set up shows in smaller cities with ... the configuration that had been touring together every year for the last 13 years. Brian and Al would not be joining for these small market dates, as was long agreed upon. 

Four days later, Wilson and Jardine submitted a written response to the rumors stating: ""After Mike booked a couple of shows with Bruce, Al and I were, of course, disappointed. Then there was confusion in some markets when photos of me, Al and David and the 50th reunion band appeared on websites advertising his shows ... I was completely blindsided by his press release ... We hadn't even discussed as a band what we were going to do with all the offers that were coming in for more 50th shows."" Love accused Wilson's statements in this press release to be falsified by his agents, again affirming that the presupposed agreements were ""well-documented"", and that Wilson had halted further touring dates. On December 13, Wilson and Jardine played a Christmas show at which they performed the Beach Boys Christmas songs. Following this appearance, Wilson announced concert dates featuring himself, Jardine and Marks. Love and Johnston continued to perform under the Beach Boys name, while Wilson, Jardine, and Marks continued to tour as a trio, and a subsequent tour with guitarist Jeff Beck also included former Beach Boy Blondie Chaplin at select dates. Reflecting upon the band's reunion in 2013, Love stated: ""I had a wonderful experience being in the studio together. Brian has lost none of his ability to structure those melodies and chord progressions, and when we heard us singing together coming back over the speakers it sounded like 1965 again. Touring was more for the fans. ... It was a great experience, it had a term to it, and now everyone's going on with their ways of doing things."" 
Jardine, Marks, Johnston and Love appeared together at the 2014 Ella Awards Ceremony, where Love was honored for his work as a singer. Marks sang ""409"" in honor of Love while Jardine performed ""Help Me Rhonda"". They closed the show by performing ""Fun, Fun, Fun"". Wilson's long time band associate Jeff Foskett also appeared, but not Wilson. On May 15, 2014 the touring Beach Boys (Love and Johnston) announced a tour celebrating ""50 Years of 'Fun Fun Fun'"", named for their 1964 single. The tour featured the addition of Foskett, who replaced Mike's son Christian. Foskett left Wilson's band due to encumbering responsibilities, and hopes that Wilson and Love's band would someday converge, believing that the two Beach Boys don't ""personally have a problem with each other."" As of September 2014, Jardine has maintained that a continued reunion with the Beach Boys is ""really up to him Love ... He claims he didn't, that he fired us after the reunion ... He's a brilliant songwriter, and unfortunately he has brilliant lawyers. We wish him all the best, but doggonit, you know, we'd like to be Beach Boys, too. There you go."" As Jardine restates ""Love doesn't really want to work with us,"" biographer Jon Stebbins speculated that Love declined to continue working with the group due to the lesser control he had over the touring process, coupled with the lower financial gain, noting: ""Night after night after night after night, Mike is making less money getting reminded that Brian is more popular than him. And he has to answer to people instead of calling all the shots himself."" 
In 2015, Soundstage aired an episode featuring Wilson performing with Jardine and former Beach Boys Blondie Chaplin and Ricky Fataar at The Venetian in Las Vegas. In April 2015, when asked if he was interested in making music with Love again, Wilson replied: ""I don't think so, no."" 

Musical style and development:
See also: The Beach Boys lineups
In Understanding Rock: Essays in Musical Analysis, music theorist Daniel Harrison summarizes: 

Even from their inception, the Beach Boys were an experimental group. They combined, as Jim Miller has put it, ""the instrumental sleekness of the Ventures, the lyric sophistication of Chuck Berry, and the vocal expertise of some weird cross between the Lettermen and Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers"" with lyrics whos images, idioms, and concerns were drawn from the rarefied world of the middle-class white male southern California teenager. ... But it was the profound vocal virtuosity of the group, coupled with the obsessional drive and compositional ambitions of their leader, Brian Wilson, that promised their survival after the eventual breaking of fad fever. ... Comparison to other vocally oriented rock groups, such as the Association, shows the Beach Boys' technique to be far superior, almost embarrassingly so. They were so confident of their ability, and of Brian's skill as a producer to enhance it, that they were unafraid of doing sophisticated, a cappella glee-club arrangements containing multiple suspensions, passing formations, complex chords, and both chromatic and enharmonic modulations. 

Influenced by doo-wop and rhythm and blues, they began as a garage band playing 1950s style rock and roll. During their early years, the Beach Boys released music that displayed an increasing level of sophistication, a period where Brian Wilson consistently acted as the group's primary bandleader, songwriter, producer, and arranger for the group's most commercially and critically successful work. Together, the band reassembled styles of music such as surf to include vocal jazz harmony, creating their unique sound. In addition, they introduced their signature approach to common genres such as the pop ballad by applying harmonic or formal twists not native to rock and roll. Miller observed, ""On straight rockers they sang tight harmonies behind Love's lead ... on ballads, Brian played his falsetto off against lush, jazz-tinged voicings, often using (for rock) unorthodox harmonic structures."" Harrison adds, ""But even the least distinguished of the Beach Boys' early uptempo rock 'n' roll songs show traces of structural complexity at some level; Brian was simply too curious and experimental to leave convention alone."" This new sound was quickly associated with the Modernism movement blooming in the Los Angeles music scene. The band later went on to incorporate many genres, from baroque pop to psychedelia and synthpop. 
In early 1964, Brian began his breakaway from beach-themed music. Later in November of the same year, the group expressed desires to advance from the surf rock style for which they initially became known for. Experimentation with psychotropic substances proved pivotal to the group's development as artists. The following month, Brian was introduced to cannabis before quickly progressing to LSD in early 1965. Of his first acid trip, Brian recalled that the drug had subjected him to ""a very religious experience"" which enlightened him to indescribable philosophies. The music for ""California Girls"", the first Beach Boys song which Bruce Johnston participated in, came from this first LSD experience, as did much of the group's subsequent work where they would often partake in drug use during recording sessions. 
Brian is quoted saying: ""Everyone contributed something. Carl kept us hip to the latest tunes, Al taught us his repertoire of folk songs, and Dennis, though he didn't initially play anything, added a combustible spark just by his presence."" Early on, Love sang lead vocals in the rock-oriented songs, while Carl contributed crisp guitar lines on the group's ballads. In a 1966 article which asks ""Do the Beach Boys rely too much on sound genius Brian?"", Carl responded that every member of the group contributes ideas, but admitted that Brian was majorly responsible for their music. 

Influences:
Further information: List of songs covered by the Beach Boys
The band's earliest influences came primarily from the work of Chuck Berry and the Four Freshmen. Performed by the Four Freshmen, ""Their Hearts Were Full of Spring"" (1961) was a particular favorite of the group. By deconstructing their arrangements of pop standards, Brian educated himself on jazz harmony. Taking this into mind, Philip Lambert noted, ""If Bob Flanigan helped teach Brian how to sing, then Gershwin, Kern, Porter, and the other members of this pantheon helped him learn how to craft a song."" Other general influences on the group included the Hi-Los,the Penguins, the Robins, Bill Haley & His Comets, Otis Williams, the Cadets, the Everly Brothers, the Belmonts, the Shirelles, the Regents, and the Crystals. While the Beach Boys are not often associated with blues, Brian has called this a misapprehension, citing Smokey Robinson and Stevie Wonder as influences. Regarding surf rock pioneer Dick Dale, Brian clarified that his influence on the group was limited to Carl and his style of guitar playing. Carl himself named Berry, the Ventures, and John Walker for shaping his guitar style, and that the Beach Boys had learned to play all of the Ventures' songs by ear early in their career. 
The influence of the Beach Boys' peers combined with Brian's competitive nature drove him to reach higher creative peaks. Sometime around late 1963, he heard the song ""Be My Baby"" (1963) by the Ronettes for the first time, revamping his creative interests and songwriting. ""Be My Baby"" is considered the epitome of Phil Spector's Wall of Sound production technique, a recording method that would fascinate Wilson for the next several decades. Brian later reflected: ""I was unable to really think as a producer up until the time where I really got familiar with Phil Spector's work. That was when I started to design the experience to be a record rather than just a song."" He kept ""Be My Baby"" on his living room jukebox, and would listen to it whenever the mood struck him. According to engineer Larry Levine, ""Brian was one of the few people in the music business Phil respected. There was a mutual respect. Brian might say that he learned how to produce from watching Phil, but the truth is, he was already producing records before he observed Phil. He just wasn't getting credit for it, something that in the early days, I remember really used to make Phil angry. Phil would tell anybody who listened that Brian was one of the great producers."" 
Other prominent inspirations for Brian included Gershwin's ""Rhapsody in Blue"" (1924),the Beatles' Rubber Soul (1965), and composer Burt Bacharach. Author Domenic Priore wrote that, in a subtle way, Brian grew to appreciate the potential of what a pop song could do after being partially spurred on by the dynamics of Bacharach's ""Walk On By"" (1964), a song which would become just as influential to him as ""Be My Baby"", supporting his strive to achieve a sense of dynamics in his recordings while he began pulling away from a purely Spector-inspired approach to production. Brian supported this by saying, ""Burt Bacharach and Hal David are more like me. They're also the best pop team - per se - today. As a producer, Bacharach has a very fresh, new approach."" 

Vocal ability:
Brian identified each member individually for their vocal range, once detailing the ranges for Carl, Dennis, Jardine (""they progress upwards through G, A, and B"") Love (""can go from bass to the E above middle C""), and himself (""I can take the second D in the treble clef""). He declared in 1966 that his greatest interest was to expand modern vocal harmony, owing his fascination with voice to the Four Freshmen which he considered a ""groovy sectional sound"". He added, ""The harmonies that we are able to produce give us a uniqueness which is really the only important thing you can put into records - some quality that no one else has got. I love peaks in a song - and enhancing them on the control panel. Most of all, I love the human voice for its own sake."" Rock critic Erik Davis wrote, ""The 'purity' of tone and genetic proximity that smoothed their voices was almost creepy, pseudo-castrato, and a 'barbershop' sound."" According to Brian: ""Jack Good once told us, 'You sing like eunuchs in a Sistine Chapel,' which was a pretty good quote."" For a period, Brian avoided singing falsetto for the group, saying ""I thought people thought I was a fairy. ... The band told me, 'If that's the way you sing, don't worry about it.'"" 
From lowest intervals to highest, the group's vocal harmony stack usually began with Love or Dennis, followed by Jardine or Carl, and finally Brian on top. Jardine explains, ""We always sang the same vocal intervals. ... As soon as we heard the chords on the piano we'd figure it out pretty easily. If there was a vocal move Brian envisioned, he'd show that particular singer that move. We had somewhat photographic memory as far as the vocal parts were concerned so that never a problem for us."" Striving for absolute perfection, Brian's intricate vocal arrangements exercised the group's calculated blend of intonation, attack, phrasing, and expression. Sometimes, he would sing each vocal harmony part alone through multi-track tape.Jimmy Webb has said, ""They used very little vibrato and sing in very straight tones. The voices all lie down beside each other very easily - there's no bumping between them because the pitch is very precise."" 

As instrumentalists:

The group's instrumental combo initially involved Brian on bass guitar and keyboards, Carl on guitar, and Dennis on drums. From an early age, Brian demonstrated an extraordinary skill for learning music by ear on keyboard. Using major Hollywood recording studios, he arranged many of his compositions for a conglomerate of session musicians informally known as the Wrecking Crew. Their assistance was needed due to the increasingly complicated nature of the material. As a result, a number of songs do not credit the Beach Boys as instrumentalists, but nearly invariably as lead, harmony, or backing vocalists. It's the belief of Richie Unterberger that ""before session musicians took over most of the parts, the Beach Boys could play respectably gutsy surf rock as a self-contained unit."" In spite of this, Carl Wilson continued to play beside these musicians whenever he was available to attend sessions. In archivist Craig Slowinski's view, ""One should not sell short Carl's own contributions; the youngest Wilson had developed as a musician sufficiently to play alongside the horde of high-dollar session pros that big brother was now bringing into the studio. Carl's guitar playing was a key ingredient."" 

Songwriting and production:

Brian's experiments with his Wollensack tape recorder provide early examples of his flair for exotica and unusual percussive patterns and arranging ideas that he would recycle in later prominent work. Through attending Phil Spector's sessions sporadically, Brian learned how to act as a producer for records while being educated on the Wall of Sound process. From then on, Brian received some production advice from Jan Berry. As they collaborated on several hit singles written and produced for other artists, they recorded what would later be regarded the California Sound. The positive commercial response to Brian's structurally irregular and harmonically varied pop compositions gave him the prestige, resources, and courage to further his creative aspirations. He proceeded to explore many unusual combinations of instruments while emphasizing inventive percussion and progressively ambitious lyricism. 
Although he was often dubbed a perfectionist, Brian was an inexperienced musician, and his understanding was mostly self-taught. He handled most stages of the group's recording process from the beginning, despite Nik Venet being credited for producing their early recordings. With regards to Brian's mid 1960s productions, ethnomusicologist David Toop characterized his style as ""cartoon music and Disney influence mutating into avant-garde pop"". Before 1966, Brian's mastery of songwriting proved that he was capable of applying odd harmonic progressions, unexpected disruptions of hypermeter,jazz theory,tempo changes, metrical ambiguity, and unusual tone colors successfully within a pop context. He made on-the-spot decisions about notes, articulation, and timbre; composing at the mixing board and using the studio as a musical instrument. Sometimes he would write songs which had melodic lines played in different keys at the same time, which confused his session musicians. In most cases, he was forced to rely on outside collaborators when it came to adding lyricism to his compositions. It was at this stage that Brian usually worked with bandmate Mike Love whose assertive persona provided youthful swagger that contrasted Brian's explorations in romanticism and sensitivity. Luis Sanchez noted a pattern where Brian would spare surfing imagery when working with collaborators outside of his band's circle in the examples ""Lonely Sea"" and ""In My Room"". 
He preferred mixing live as performances were recorded, as opposed to mixing after the fact. He was open to changes suggested by others while recording, often taking advice and even incorporating apparent mistakes if they provided a useful or interesting alternative. He experimented with processed effects including varispeed, reverberation, slapback echo, and filtering signals through a Leslie speaker. Lyric collaborator Tony Asher remembers that in the 1960s: ""People would try whatever they could think of that was unexpected, just for its own sake...spend three days and call in a bunch of oboe players. Try an instrument just because nobody had ever used it, and in the end, it wasn't in the final mix. That never happened with Brian. He did the same kind of experimenting, not to see if he could accidentally stumble onto something unique, but he did these unique things because that's what he wanted to hear. And most of the time, it ended up on the record."" Once an instrumental track was completed, vocals would then be overdubbed by the group. On Surfin' U.S.A. (1963), Brian began doubletracking. As was practiced by other record producers from the 1960s, most of his mixes ended up in single-channel monaural, believing that varied stereo speaker placement took his control over the sound image away to the listener. 
Eschewing Capitol Studios which Brian considered inadequate, engineer Chuck Britz often collaborated with him at Western 3 of United Western Recorders, also serving as a buffer between Brian and the oft-berating Murry whenever he was present. Once Britz assembled a preliminary recording setup, Brian would take over the console, directing the instrumentalists from the booth using an intercom or verbal gestures after supplying them with chord charts which were sometimes written incorrectly. It's reported that even though Britz was responsible for setting up recording, Brian would then adjust his configuration to a large extent. Asher adds: ""As unorganized or even unproductive as he Brian could be in other situations, when he got into a recording session, you had the sense he had ideas that were gonna get away from him if he didn't get 'em done right away. He was willing to have people be relaxed and joke a little bit, but he wanted to get work done. And he sometimes lost his temper just a little bit if Chuck couldn't find a take."" At Gold Star Studios, Brian worked mainly with engineers Stan Ross and, with lesser frequency, Larry Levine. Ross said of Brian, ""he liked the sound Gold Star got on the instrumentation, but he did the voices elsewhere because we were limited to two or three tracks and that wasn't enough for voice overdubbing. ... The tracks were really rhythm pads that would be sweetened after the voices were put on."" 

As Brian's productions advanced, he became recognized for his pop artistry, vocal harmonization, incessant studio perfectionism, forward-thinking song structures, engineering and mixing know-how, and creative multitasking abilities. It was unusual among rock groups that Brian wrote his own arrangements. This included his own string orchestrations, which Asher referred to for their odd voicings and classical style. Session bassist Carol Kaye noted, ""We had to create instrumental parts for all the other groups we cut for, but not Brian. We were in awe of Brian."" Friend Danny Hutton expressed similar feelings while highlighting Brian's studio proficiency, citing what he believed to be an extraordinary talent at harnessing several different studio spaces while piecing together discrete instrumental patterns and timbres cohesively. He noted, ""Somebody could go in right after Brian's session and try to record, and they could never get the sound he got. There was a lot of subtle stuff he did. ... People don't talk that much about it. They always talk about his music. He was fabulous in the studio, in terms of getting sounds. You'd sit there, and that was him. He was just hands-on. He would change the reverb and the echo, and all of a sudden, something just - whoa! - got twice as big and fat."" 
Foreshadowed by Beach Boys' Party! (1965), much of the group's recordings from 1967 to 1970 displayed sparse instrumentation, a more relaxed ensemble, and a seeming inattention to production quality. Brian briefly experimented with musique concrete and minimalist rock approaches to music before retreating to his home recording studio to record ""manic"" material in the 1970s, enacting syncopated exercises and counterpoints layered on jittery eighth note tone clusters and loping shuffle grooves. During the infancy of Brian's home studio, the group was forced to improvise many technical aspects of recording. In one instance, they used an empty swimming pool as an echo chamber. 
When Brian abdicated from the group, the other members were forced to take a more active production role. This is believed to have faltered the quality of their music.Richie Unterberger believes that after the December 1967 release of Wild Honey, ""the Beach Boys were revealed as a group that, although capable of producing some fine and interesting music, were no longer innovators on the level of the Beatles and other figureheads."" The album marked the beginning of Carl's increased role as producer, who described it as ""music for Brian to cool out by,"" signaling a mellower approach which would pervade into the 1970s. In 1968, Dennis contributed original songs to Friends, revealing himself as a broodingly soulful songwriter and singer, while Bruce Johnston devised a moody instrumental, ""The Nearest Faraway Place"", for 20/20 the following year.Sunflower (1970) marked an end to the experimental songwriting and production phase initiated by Smiley Smile (1967). Of the albums between Surf's Up (1971) and Holland (1973), Daniel Harrison wrote that they ""contain a mixture of middle-of-the-road music entirely consonant with pop style during the early 1970s with a few oddities that proved that the desire to push beyond conventional boundaries was not dead."" While Harrison adamantly states ""1974 is the year in which the Beach Boys ceased to be a rock 'n' roll act and became an oldies act,""Love You (1977) is perceived by some as an oddity that sounds like no other record in their catalog with synthesizer-laden arrangements played almost entirely by Brian.

Cultural impact and influence:

Regarded by some critics as one of the greatest American rock groups and an important catalyst in the evolution of popular music, the Beach Boys are one of the most critically acclaimed, commercially successful, and widely influential bands of all time. The Beach Boys' sales estimates range from 100 to 350 million records worldwide, and have influenced artists spanning many genres and decades. The group's early songs made them major pop stars in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and other countries, having sixteen hit singles between 1962 and 1965. They were one of the few American bands formed prior to the 1964 British Invasion to continue their success. Among artists of the 1960s, they are one of few central figures in the histories of rock. 
Their early hits helped raise the profile of the state of California, creating its first major regional style with national significance, and establishing a musical identity for Southern California, as opposed to Hollywood. This also associated the band with surfing, hot-rod racing, and a contemporaneous teenage lifestyle and fantasy. There had been surf bands formed prior to the Beach Boys, but none which projected a world view as the Beach Boys did. The resultant ""California Sound"" later morphed itself to reflect a more musically ambitious and mature world view, becoming less to do with surfing and cars and more about social consciousness and political awareness. Between 1964 and 1969, it fueled innovation and transition, inspiring artists to tackle largely unmentioned themes such as sexual freedom, black pride, drugs, oppositional politics, and war. 
Brian's work is credited as a major innovation in the field of music production. According to Erik Davis, ""Not only did the Beach Boys write a soundtrack to the early '60s, but Brian let loose a delicate and joyful art pop unique in music history and presaged the mellowness so fundamental to '70s California pop.""The A.V. Club wrote that Brian was among ""studio rats ... that set the pace for how pop music could and should sound in the Flower Power era: at once starry-eyed and wistful."" Only 21-years-old when he received the freedom to produce his own records with total creative autonomy, he ignited an explosion of like-minded California producers, supplanting New York as the center of popular records, and becoming the first rock producer to use the studio as a discrete instrument. The Beach Boys were thus one of the first rock groups to exert studio control. 
The group was among early (or earliest) instigators of psychedelic rock,acid rock,art rock,art pop,progressive rock, and sunshine pop. They attracted a following from a great number of their pop or rock contemporaries during the 1960s, including the Beatles,the Rolling Stones,Harry Nilsson,Cream,George Martin,the Who,Pink Floyd,Lou Reed of The Velvet Underground, and Frank Zappa. Additionally, they influenced pioneering musicians for glam rock: David Bowie and Marc Bolan;krautrock: Faust,Kraftwerk;power pop: Big Star; and new wave: Talking Heads. 
The Beach Boys helped create power pop, and in the 1970s, they were paid homage by punk rockers such as Ramones,Patti Smith, and Lester Bangs. Partly in due to the Ramones, many acts which Stereogum called ""punk or punk-adjacent"" showcased influence from the Beach Boys: Slickee Boys, Agent Orange, Bad Religion, Shonen Knife, the Queers, Hi-Standard, the Donnas, M.O.D.. and the Vandals. The group eventually bore a strong influence on indie rock. Over the years, the group's songs have been the subject of many tribute albums, several of which are compiled from cover versions contributed by various artists from a wide range of backgrounds including Japanese noise, pop punk, rockabilly, and trip hop. 
In the 1990s, the Beach Boys received a resurgence of popularity with alternative rock groups and young record-buyers of independent music. According to Sean O'Hagan of the High Llamas, ""they stopped listening to indie records"" in favor of the Beach Boys. Bands who advocated for the band included founding members of the Elephant 6 Collective: Neutral Milk Hotel, the Olivia Tremor Control, the Apples in Stereo, and of Montreal. United by a shared love of the Beach Boys' music, they named Pet Sounds Studio in honor of the group. Other influenced artists who gained prominence in underground circles during the 1980s and 1990s include shoegaze band My Bloody Valentine,electronica outfits Daft Punk,Saint Etienne,The High Llamas,the Avalanches,Stereolab, and alternative rock musicians Radiohead,Sonic Youth,Frank Black of Pixies,Jim Reid of the Jesus and Mary Chain, and Paddy McAloon of Prefab Sprout. In Japan, their music affected the work of noise rock bands Seagull Screaming Kiss Her Kiss Her and Melt-Banana. 
Other 20th century artists influenced by the Beach Boys include ABBA,Rivers Cuomo of Weezer,Fleetwood Mac,Cheap Trick,Chicago,Elton John,Flipper's Guitar,Todd Rundgren,Keiichi Suzuki,Yo La Tengo,Tatsuro Yamashita,Yellow Magic Orchestra, and XTC. The Beach Boys' influence has continued to pervade in such millennial artists as Air,Animal Collective,Fleet Foxes,MGMT,Super Furry Animals, and Frank Ocean. 

Reappraisal:
Professor of cultural studies James M. Curtis wrote in 1987, 

... we can say that the Beach Boys represent the outlook and values of white Protestant Anglo-Saxon teenagers in the early sixties. Having said that, we immediately realize that they must mean much more than this. Their stability, their staying power, and their ability to attract new fans prove as much. 

Historian Darren R. Reid added in 2013, ""Imagine, if you will, a world in which the Beatles were known only for their early hits whilst The White Album or Abbey Road were of interest, or even known, only to the group's biggest fans, and you will have some grasp of how the Beach Boys' distorted public image has helped to bury their most important artistic works."" 

Throughout their career, the Beach Boys struggled with their public image and audiences. Musicologist Charlie Gillett explains, ""By 1965, the Beach Boys had become an American pop institution, but although they continued to cultivate a visual image in line with their name and early repertoire, there was a limit to how many different ways Wilson could celebrate the wonders of living in Southern California ... Originally, many serious pop fans dismissed the group as trashy pop for kids."" Their growing complexity caused their live performances to suffer in the mid 1960s, when the group began to be derided by audiences for their uniformed striped shirts compounded by low key reproductions of songs which demanded complicated orchestrations. Because of their early hits, which celebrated a politically unconscious youth culture, the group's legitimacy in rock music became an oft-repeated criticism toward the band. In 1970, the group ceased wearing matching uniforms on stage and began emphasizing political and social awareness. Drawing from their associations with Charles Manson and Ronald Reagan, Erik Davis observed, ""the Beach Boys may be the only bridge between those deranged poles. There is a wider range of political and aesthetic sentiments in their records than in any other band in those heady times--like the state of California, they expand and bloat and contradict themselves."" 
Despite the group's immense popularity and success, some consider that the extent of their contribution to Western music canon is undervalued. In 1967, Lou Reed famously wrote, ""Will none of the powers that be realize what Brian Wilson did with the chords?""Pitchfork Media posited, ""At some point, you learn that the Beach Boys weren't just a fun 1960s surf band with a run of singles that later came to be used in commercials; at their best, they were making capital-A Art. ... Once you've absorbed Pet Sounds, you find yourself going back through songs like ""Don't Worry Baby"", ""The Warmth of the Sun"", and ""I Get Around"", finding a deeper brilliance where you once heard only pop craftsmanship."" Discussing the 2011 release of The Smile Sessions, The Los Angeles Times wrote, ""...certainly every library of American recording history needs this; university composition departments, music professors, budding recording engineers and composers should study it."" 

I think a lot of critics punish the band for not going beyond ""Good Vibrations"" ... I think they love the band so much that they get crazy because we don't top ourselves. ... every time there's a new Beach Boy record it competes with so many old Beach Boy records on the radio. ... the audience is so young and they're reacting more to the Beach Boys sound-alike commercials on TV and the three or four really big, quadruple platinum repackage albums. I'm not down on any of that stuff, but ... growth in this business is tough 

--Bruce Johnston speaking to the Houston Chronicle, August 1982

Online publication NewMusicBox - which normally devotes itself to new American music that is outside the commercial mainstream - argued that the Beach Boys could never earn themselves ""the same pride of place in American music history held by other great innovators"" because of their mistaken reputation as a ""light-hearted party band that drooled over 'California Girls' while on a 'Surfing Safari'"" hampered not only by the over-saturation of their early songs being used in film, commercials, and other media, but also ""their latter-day cover-band-version-of-their-former-selves concert appearances"". Referring to the groups' reaction to the commercial success of their 1974 greatest hits compilation Endless Summer, Daniel Harrison writes, ""they returned to the beach, knowing they would never leave it again."" Erik Davis wrote that by 1990, ""the Beach Boys are either dead, deranged, or dinosaurs; their records are Eurocentric, square, unsampled; they've made too much money to merit hip revisionism."" From the same period, Jim Miller wrote, ""They have become a figment of their own past, prisoners of their unflagging popularity--incongruous emblems of a sunny myth of eternal youth belied by much of their own best music. ... The group is still largely identified with its hits from the early Sixties."" 
Harrison, however, contests that the group once produced work which could ""almost"" be considered art music in the Western classical tradition, and that group's innovations in the musical language of rock can be compared to those that introduced atonal and other nontraditional techniques into that classical tradition. He explains, ""The spirit of experimentation is just as palpable in Smiley Smile as it is in, say, Schoenberg's op. 11 piano pieces."" While the group ""went into the great void beyond,"" such notions were not widely acknowledged by rock audiences nor by the classically minded at the time. Harrison concludes: ""What influences could these innovations then have? The short answer is, not much. Smiley Smile, Wild Honey, Friends, and 20/20 sound like few other rock albums; they are sui generis. ... It must be remembered that the commercial failure of the Beach Boys' experiments was hardly motivation for imitation. In the end, we must conclude that the Beach Boys' late-1960s experiments were not reproducible."" 

Awards and honors:

The group routinely appears in the upper reaches of ranked lists such as ""The Top 1000 Albums of All Time"". Many of the group's songs and albums including The Beach Boys Today! (1965), Smiley Smile (1967), Sunflower (1970), and Surf's Up (1971) are featured in several lists devoted to the greatest of all time. The 1966 releases Pet Sounds and ""Good Vibrations"" frequently rank among the top of critics' lists of the greatest albums and singles of all time. In 2004, Pet Sounds was preserved in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress for being ""culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant."" On Acclaimed Music, ""Good Vibrations"" is ranked the third best song of all time, while ""God Only Knows"" is ranked twenty-first; the group itself is ranked eleven in its 1000 most recommended artists of all time. 
In 1966 and 1967, reader polls conducted by the UK magazine NME crowned the Beach Boys as the world's number one vocal group, ahead of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. In 1974, the Beach Boys were awarded ""Band of the Year"" by Rolling Stone. On December 30, 1980, the Beach Boys were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, located at 1500 Vine Street. The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988. Ten years later they were selected for the Vocal Group Hall of Fame. In 2001, the group received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked the Beach Boys number 12 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. Brian Wilson was inducted into the UK Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in November 2006. 
The Wilsons' California house, where the Wilson brothers grew up and the group began, was demolished in 1986 to make way for Interstate 105, the Century Freeway.

In the early 70s, they were the first to pair heavily distorted, sonically dissonant blues rock at slow speeds with lyrics about drugs, mental pain and abominations of war, thus giving birth to generations of metal bands that followed in their wake. Their name itself taken from a notorious horror film, they are often credited with creating the heavy metal genre as well as the doom metal subgenre.  Black Sabbath was formed in Aston, a poor district of Birmingham damaged by bombing during World War II, under the name Polka Tulk Blues Band (soon shortened to ""Polka Tulk""), later Earth. Initially a rockin' blues band, Earth moved in a darker direction when the group, especially bassist Geezer Butler, being fans of the black magic novels of Dennis Wheatley, tried to make music to have the same effect as a horror movie or novel. Ozzy Osbourne wrote the lyrics to the second song they wrote together, ""Black Sabbath"" (the song name was inspired by a 1963 Mario Bava film), and Tony Iommi wrote a riff based on the tritone, sometimes called ""Diabolus en Musica"" (""the Devil in Music"").  Later in their careers, Geezer Butler would write most of the lyrics to Black Sabbath songs, taking direct inspiration from Ozzy's instrumental ideas. In their Last Supper concert film, the band stated that the song is based on an experience Geezer had one night when he saw a black object at the end of his bed and noticed the next day that an occult book Ozzy had given him was missing. When the band found themselves being confused with another local band called Earth, which had a far lighter sound, they adopted the song title as their new name.  As the band evolved, they added more European folk elements and gothic flourishes to their sound, which was like few groups during their time. Their lyrics dealt with darker issues than most conventional rock. Towards the late 60s, many British bands were into the peace movement and the hippie subculture, whilst Sabbath chose to distinguish themselves by dealing with heavier issues; the occult, war, apocalypse, drugs, and gothic storytelling. Their music conveyed a sense of anger and anti-establishment, the likes of which took previous rowdy vibes from the work of The Rolling Stones, The Who, The Doors, and other such bands into a coarse, almost nihilistic direction.  It was this mix of dark lyrical themes and a slower, ominous sound that made Black Sabbath a significant element in the genre that would later be known as heavy metal. Alongside self-consciously 'heavy' contemporaries such as Iron Butterfly, Led Zeppelin, Steppenwolf, and a few others of the late 60s, Black Sabbath would be massively influential as the years passed. Almost countless bands have covered their work either live or in studio.  Despite their doom-laden image, much of the group's early material featured acoustic guitars, piano, symphony orchestras, keyboards, and even horns. The band's members strongly resisted labeling as being Satanists or other such things themselves; for example, Ozzy in particular decided to prank occultists setting up outside of one of their dressing rooms by re-arranging their candles to read 'Happy Birthday'. The label of making music dangerously seductive to the young would remain with the group throughout its career and be applied to many later metal groups.  After the band's first four albums, the group became increasingly psychedelic, experimental, and progressive, leaving much of their dark, metallic roots behind. The last two Osbourne-fronted albums, 'Technical Ecstasy' (1976) and 'Never Say Die!' (1978) left a lot of fans dissatisfied with the band, as drugs and alcohol abuse began to take its toll on each member. Some signs seemed to point to the group's complete collapse.  Osbourne was fired in 1978 for becoming increasingly unstable and unwilling to work with the material that, by this time, Tony Iommi was writing more or less entirely himself. Osbourne started a highly successful solo career in 1980. Still, his personal demons continued to haunt him for decades onward, even as he became one of the most iconic modern vocalists of all time.  In 1979, Tony Iommi recruited former Rainbow members; singer Ronnie James Dio and bassist Craig Gruber. Gruber was recruited because Geezer Butler was unhappy with Osbourne's departure, and was rumoured to have quit the band. Gruber was dismissed and Geezer rejoined. Black Sabbath's first album with Dio, Heaven and Hell, proved to be a success, and saw the band's highest American charting since 1975's Sabotage. It was on this tour that Dio popularised the ""devil horns"" hand gesture, which has since become a symbol of heavy metal music in general. The album also marked the inclusion of Quartz's guitarist-turned-keyboardist Geoff Nicholls (Nicholls has not been consistently credited as an official member, and has always been forced to play live shows from off stage (except on the Seventh Star tour in 1986 where he played on stage) supposedly for aesthetic reasons, but he has co-written many songs and has stayed with Black Sabbath through all subsequent incarnations, until he finally left in 2004. Adam Wakeman, son of Rick Wakeman, took over in 2005). Also during the tour, drummer Bill Ward quit the band for personal reasons (both his parents died within a rather short period, and Ward was struggling with alcoholism and other addictions). Drummer Vinny Appice joined to complete the tour and then record the next album Mob Rules, in which an early version of the title track appeared in the film Heavy Metal.  Ronnie James Dio and drummer Vinny Appice left the band after supposed disputes concerning the mixing of the live album Live Evil, and pursued a solo career together. Black Sabbath re-enlisted drummer Bill Ward, and, along with ex-Deep Purple singer Ian Gillan (who agreed to join the band whilst heavily intoxicated), released Born Again in 1983. It reached a respectable number two in the U.K. music charts, a success not seen since Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, ten years previously. However, the album was not received particularly fondly by critics or fans alike, and not even by singer Ian Gillan. The tour that followed was to provide a wealth of material for the spoof documentary on rock 'n' roll culture, Spinal Tap. Drummer Bill Ward was still recovering from poor health and so did not tour for the Born Again album. Instead, fellow Brummie Bev Bevan, formerly of The Move and The Electric Light Orchestra, took to the drumstool for the tour obligations.  Once the tour was over, Ian Gillan left the band to rejoin his Mk.2 Deep Purple band mates. From here on the line-ups of Black Sabbath changed relentlessly, with Tony Iommi being the only constant member. Between 1986 and 1995 Black Sabbath released 7 studio albums and one live album, including a reunion album with the Mob Rules line-up (1992's Dehumanizer). The 5 Albums 1987 -1990 & 1994 - 1995 feature 2nd Longest Serving Singer of Black Sabbath Tony Martin, both Headless Cross (1989) & TYR (1990) albums are considered Black Sabbath Classic's by Hardcore fans. In 1997 the original line-up reunited for a proper world tour (as opposed to the one-off Live Aid in 1985, and Costa Mesa gigs on Ozzy's ""Farewell"" tour in 1992) and have toured on and off since.  In 2007, the Mob Rules line-up reunited under the banner Heaven & Hell and toured in support of Black Sabbath - The Best of: The Dio Years featuring three new tracks and a release of Black Sabbath Live at the Hammersmith Odeon, 1982. They released a live CD/DVD and released a studio album of entirely new songs in April 2009. Ronnie James Dio died from stomach cancer in 2010, his Heaven & Hell album being the last of his studio performances. Neon Nights: Live at Wacken was released the following year on CD/DVD.  On 11th November 2011, the original line-up of Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward hosted a press conference in which they stated they would be touring once more, their first shows since 2005, and recording their first album together since 1978's Never Say Die! However, the tour was radically reduced in scale as Iommi sought treatment for Lymphoma. In early 2012 Bill Ward publicly stated he would no longer be involved in the upcoming tour and album as he had been offered an ""unsignable contract"". Tommy Clufetos (Ozzy Osbourne, ex-Firewind, ex-Rob Zombie, ex-Alice Cooper) was asked to to join for touring obligations. Black Sabbath selected Rage Against the Machine drummer Brad Wilk to record on their nineteenth album ""13"".  VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock"" ranked them second, behind Led Zeppelin. They were inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006.  Aside from being arguably the first heavy metal band, Black Sabbath also directly influenced many later metal sub-genres with their sound and imagery. Examples can be seen especially in doom metal and stoner metal, which are directly descended from Black Sabbath's original sound, with songs such as ""Black Sabbath"", ""Into the Void"", ""Hand of Doom"" and others showcasing Black Sabbath's staple doom sound. Other sub-genres influenced by Sabbath's sound also include speed metal and thrash metal on the opposite side, ""Paranoid"" and ""Symptom of the Universe"" are considered early examples of these genres. Black Sabbath's lyrical use of hell, death, Satan and horror as imagery also greatly influenced heavy metal, as these themes are prevalent in nearly all heavy metal sub-genres.  In December 2008 Iommi filed a lawsuit against merchandise company LiveNation for continuing to use the Black Sabbath name and Tony Iommi's likeness to sell merchandise, even after their contract had ended. On May 26, 2009 Osbourne filed suit in a federal court in New York against Iommi alleging that he illegally claimed the band name. Iommi noted that he has been the only band member for the full forty one years of the band, and that his bandmates relinquished their rights to the name in the 1980s, therefore claiming more rights to the name of the band. Although, in the suit, Osbourne is seeking 50% ownership of the trademark, he has said that he hopes the proceedings will lead to equal ownership among the four original members.

The success ..., Black Sabbath are an English rock band, formed in Birmingham in 1968, by guitarist and main songwriter Tony Iommi, bassist and main lyricist Geezer Butler, singer Ozzy Osbourne, and drummer Bill Ward. The band have since experienced multiple line-up changes, with guitarist Iommi being the only constant presence in the band through the years. Originally formed in 1968 as a blues rock band, the group soon adopted the Black Sabbath moniker and began incorporating occult themes with horror-inspired lyrics and tuned-down guitars. Despite an association with these two themes, Black Sabbath also composed songs dealing with social instability, political corruption, the dangers of drug abuse and apocalyptic prophecies of the horrors of war. 
Osbourne's regular abuse of drugs and alcohol led to his dismissal from the band in 1979. He was replaced by former Rainbow vocalist Ronnie James Dio. Following two albums with Dio, Black Sabbath endured countless personnel changes in the 1980s and 1990s that included vocalists Ian Gillan, Glenn Hughes, Ray Gillen and Tony Martin, as well as several drummers and bassists. In 1992, Iommi and Butler rejoined Dio and drummer Vinny Appice to record Dehumanizer. The original line-up reunited with Osbourne in 1997 and released a live album Reunion. Black Sabbath's 19th studio album, 13, which features all of the original members but Ward, was released in June 2013. 
Black Sabbath are often cited as pioneers of heavy metal music. The band helped define the genre with releases such as Black Sabbath (1970), Paranoid (1970) and Master of Reality (1971). They were ranked by MTV as the ""Greatest Metal Band"" of all time, and placed second in VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock"" list. Rolling Stone magazine ranked them number 85 in their ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"". They have sold over 70 million records worldwide. Black Sabbath were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. They have also won two Grammy Awards for Best Metal Performance. 

History:

Formation and early days (1968-69):
Following the break-up of their previous band Mythology in 1968, guitarist Tony Iommi and drummer Bill Ward sought to form a heavy blues rock band in Aston, Birmingham. They enlisted bassist Geezer Butler and vocalist Ozzy Osbourne, who had played together in a band called Rare Breed, Osbourne having placed an advertisement in a local music shop: ""Ozzy Zig Needs Gig - has own PA"". The new group was initially named the Polka Tulk Blues Band, the name taken either from a brand of talcum powder or an Indian/Pakistani clothing shop; the exact origin is confused. The Polka Tulk Blues Band featured slide guitarist Jimmy Phillips, a childhood friend of Osbourne's, and saxophonist Alan ""Aker"" Clarke. After shortening the name to Polka Tulk, the band again changed their name to Earth (which Osbourne hated) and continued as a four-piece without Phillips and Clarke. Iommi became concerned that Phillips and Clarke lacked the necessary dedication and were not taking the band seriously. Rather than asking them to leave, they instead decided to break up and then quietly reformed the band as a four-piece. While the band was performing under the Earth title, they recorded several demos written by Norman Haines such as ""The Rebel"", ""Song for Jim"", and ""When I Came Down"". The demo titled ""Song for Jim"" was in reference to Jim Simpson. Jim Simpson was a manager for the bands Bakerloo Blues Line and Tea & Symphony. Simpson was also a trumpet player for the group Locomotive. Simpson had recently opened a new pub named Henry's Blues House and offered to let Earth play some gigs in his club. The audience response was positive and Simpson agreed to manage Earth. 
In December 1968, Iommi abruptly left Earth to join Jethro Tull. Although his stint with the band would be short-lived, Iommi made an appearance with Jethro Tull on The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus TV show. Unsatisfied with the direction of Jethro Tull, Iommi returned to Earth in January 1969. ""It just wasn't right, so I left"", Iommi said. ""At first I thought Tull were great, but I didn't much go for having a leader in the band, which was Ian Anderson's way. When I came back from Tull, I came back with a new attitude altogether. They taught me that to get on, you got to work for it."" 
While playing shows in England in 1969, the band discovered they were being mistaken for another English group named Earth. They decided to change their name again. A cinema across the street from the band's rehearsal room was showing the 1963 Mario Bava horror film Black Sabbath starring Boris Karloff. While watching people line up to see the film, Butler noted that it was ""strange that people spend so much money to see scary movies."" Following that, Osbourne and Butler wrote the lyrics for a song called ""Black Sabbath"", which was inspired by the work of horror and adventure-story writer Dennis Wheatley, along with a vision that Butler had of a black silhouetted figure standing at the foot of his bed. Making use of the musical tritone, also known as ""the Devil's Interval"", the song's ominous sound and dark lyrics pushed the band in a darker direction, a stark contrast to the popular music of the late 1960s, which was dominated by flower power, folk music, and hippie culture. Judas Priest frontman Rob Halford has called the track ""probably the most evil song ever written"". Inspired by the new sound, the band changed their name to Black Sabbath in August 1969, and made the decision to focus on writing similar material, in an attempt to create the musical equivalent of horror films. 

Black Sabbath and Paranoid (1970-71):
The band's first show as Black Sabbath took place on 30 August 1969, in Workington. They were signed to Philips Records in November 1969, and released their first single, ""Evil Woman"" (a cover of a song by the band Crow) through Philips subsidiary Fontana Records in January 1970 at Trident Studios. Later releases were handled by Philips' newly formed progressive rock label, Vertigo Records. Black Sabbath's first major exposure came when the band appeared on John Peel's Top Gear radio show in 1969, performing ""Black Sabbath"", ""NIB"", ""Behind the Wall of Sleep"", and ""Sleeping Village"" to a national audience in Great Britain shortly before recording of their first album commenced. Although the ""Evil Woman"" single failed to chart, the band were afforded two days of studio time in November to record their debut album with producer Rodger Bain. Iommi recalls recording live: ""We thought 'We have two days to do it and one of the days is mixing.' So we played live. Ozzy was singing at the same time, we just put him in a separate booth and off we went. We never had a second run of most of the stuff."" 
Black Sabbath was released on Friday the 13th, February 1970, and reached number 8 in the UK Albums Chart. Following its US and Canadian release in May 1970 by Warner Bros. Records, the album reached number 23 on the Billboard 200, where it remained for over a year. The album was a commercial success but was widely panned by some critics. Lester Bangs dismissed it in a Rolling Stone review as ""discordant jams with bass and guitar reeling like velocitised speedfreaks all over each other's musical perimeters, yet never quite finding synch"". It sold in substantial numbers despite being panned, giving the band their first mainstream exposure. It has since been certified platinum in both US by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and in the UK by British Phonographic Industry (BPI). 
To capitalise on their chart success in the US, the band returned to the studio in June 1970, just four months after Black Sabbath was released. The new album was initially set to be named War Pigs after the song ""War Pigs"", which was critical of the Vietnam War; however, Warner changed the title of the album to Paranoid. The album's lead-off single, ""Paranoid"", was written in the studio at the last minute. Ward explains: ""We didn't have enough songs for the album, and Tony just played the Paranoid guitar lick and that was it. It took twenty, twenty-five minutes from top to bottom."" The single was released in September 1970 and reached number four on the UK charts, remaining Black Sabbath's only top ten hit. The album followed in the UK in October 1970, where, pushed by the success of the ""Paranoid"" single, it made number one in the charts. 
The US release was held off until January 1971, as the Black Sabbath album was still on the charts at the time of Paranoid's UK release. Black Sabbath subsequently toured America for the first time and played their first US show at a club called Ungano's at 210 West 70th Street in New York City. The album reached No. 12 in the US in March 1971, and would go on to sell four million copies in the US, with virtually no radio airplay. Like Black Sabbath, the album was panned by rock critics of the era, but modern-day reviewers such as AllMusic's Steve Huey cite Paranoid as ""one of the greatest and most influential heavy metal albums of all time"", which ""defined the sound and style of heavy metal more than any other record in rock history"". The album was ranked at No. 131 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.Paranoid‍ '​s chart success allowed the band to tour the US for the first time in October 1970, which spawned the release of the album's second single ""Iron Man"". Although the single failed to reach the top 40, ""Iron Man"" remains one of Black Sabbath's most popular songs, as well as the band's highest charting US single until 1998's ""Psycho Man"". 

Master of Reality and Volume 4 (1971-73):
In February 1971, after a one off performance at the Myponga Pop Festival in Australia, Black Sabbath returned to the studio to begin work on their third album. Following the chart success of Paranoid, the band were afforded more studio time, along with a ""briefcase full of cash"" to buy drugs. ""We were getting into coke, big time"", Ward explained. ""Uppers, downers, Quaaludes, whatever you like. It got to the stage where you come up with ideas and forget them, because you were just so out of it."" 
Production completed in April 1971, in July the band released Master of Reality, just six months after the US release of Paranoid. The album reached the top ten in both the US and UK, and was certified gold in less than two months, eventually receiving platinum certification in the 1980s and Double Platinum in the early 21st century.Master of Reality contained Black Sabbath's first acoustic songs, alongside fan favourites such as ""Children of the Grave"" and ""Sweet Leaf"". Critical response of the era was generally unfavourable, with Lester Bangs delivering an ambivalent review of Master of Reality in Rolling Stone, describing the closing song ""Children of the Grave"" as ""naïve, simplistic, repetitive, absolute doggerel - but in the tradition of rock'n'roll ... The only criterion is excitement, and Black Sabbath's got it"". In 2003, Rolling Stone would place the album at number 300 on their 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list. 
Following the Master of Reality world tour in 1972, Black Sabbath took its first break in three years. As Ward explained: ""The band started to become very fatigued and very tired. We'd been on the road non-stop, year in and year out, constantly touring and recording. I think Master of Reality was kind of like the end of an era, the first three albums, and we decided to take our time with the next album."" 
In June 1972, the band reconvened in Los Angeles to begin work on their next album at the Record Plant. The recording process was plagued with problems, many as a result of substance abuse issues. While struggling to record the song ""Cornucopia"" after ""sitting in the middle of the room, just doing drugs"", Ward was nearly fired from the band. ""I hated the song, there were some patterns that were just ... horrible"" Ward said. ""I nailed it in the end, but the reaction I got was the cold shoulder from everybody. It was like 'Well, just go home, you're not being of any use right now.' I felt like I'd blown it, I was about to get fired"". The album was originally titled ""Snowblind"" after the song of the same name, which deals with cocaine abuse. The record company changed the title at the last minute to Black Sabbath Vol. 4, with Ward stating ""There was no Volume 1, 2 or 3, so it's a pretty stupid title really"". 
Black Sabbath Vol. 4 was released in September 1972, and while critics were dismissive of the album upon release, it achieved gold status in less than a month, and was the band's fourth consecutive release to sell a million copies in the US. With more time in the studio, the album saw the band starting to experiment with new textures, such as strings, piano, orchestration and multi-part songs. The song ""Tomorrow's Dream"" was released as a single - the band's first since Paranoid - but failed to chart. Following an extensive tour of the US, in 1973 the band travelled again to Australia, followed by a tour for the first time to New Zealand, before moving onto mainland Europe. 

Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and Sabotage (1973-76):
Following the Volume 4 world tour, Black Sabbath returned to Los Angeles to begin work on their next release. Pleased with the Volume 4 album, the band sought to recreate the recording atmosphere, and returned to the Record Plant studio in Los Angeles. With new musical innovations of the era, the band were surprised to find that the room they had used previously at the Record Plant was replaced by a ""giant synthesiser"". The band rented a house in Bel Air and began writing in the summer of 1973, but in part because of substance issues and fatigue, they were unable to complete any songs. ""Ideas weren't coming out the way they were on Volume 4 and we really got discontent"" Iommi said. ""Everybody was sitting there waiting for me to come up with something. I just couldn't think of anything. And if I didn't come up with anything, nobody would do anything."" 

After a month in Los Angeles with no results, the band opted to return to England. They rented Clearwell Castle in The Forest of Dean. ""We rehearsed in the dungeons and it was really creepy but it had some atmosphere, it conjured up things, and stuff started coming out again."" While working in the dungeon, Iommi stumbled onto the main riff of ""Sabbath Bloody Sabbath,"" which set the tone for the new material. Recorded at Morgan Studios in London by Mike Butcher and building off the stylistic changes introduced on Volume 4, new songs incorporated synthesisers, strings, and complex arrangements. Yes keyboardist Rick Wakeman was brought in as a session player, appearing on ""Sabbra Cadabra"". 
In November 1973, Black Sabbath began to receive positive reviews in the mainstream press after the release of Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, with Gordon Fletcher of Rolling Stone calling the album ""an extraordinarily gripping affair,"" and ""nothing less than a complete success."" Later reviewers such as Allmusic's Eduardo Rivadavia cite the album as a ""masterpiece, essential to any heavy metal collection,"" while also displaying ""a newfound sense of finesse and maturity."" The album marked the band's fifth consecutive platinum selling album in the US, reaching number four on the UK charts, and number eleven in the US. 
The band began a world tour in January 1974, which culminated at the California Jam festival in Ontario, California on 6 April 1974. Attracting over 200,000 fans, Black Sabbath appeared alongside popular 1970s rock and pop bands Deep Purple, Eagles, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Rare Earth, Seals & Crofts, Black Oak Arkansas, and Earth, Wind & Fire. Portions of the show were telecast on ABC Television in the US, exposing the band to a wider American audience. In the same year, the band shifted management, signing with notorious English manager Don Arden. The move caused a contractual dispute with Black Sabbath's former management, and while on stage in the US, Osbourne was handed a subpoena that led to two years of litigation. 
Black Sabbath began work on their sixth album in February 1975, again in England at Morgan Studios in Willesden, this time with a decisive vision to differ the sound from Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath. ""We could've continued and gone on and on, getting more technical, using orchestras and everything else which we didn't particularly want to. We took a look at ourselves, and we wanted to do a rock album - Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath wasn't a rock album, really."" Produced by Black Sabbath and Mike Butcher, Sabotage was released in July 1975. As with its precursor, the album initially saw favourable reviews, with Rolling Stone stating ""Sabotage is not only Black Sabbath's best record since Paranoid, it might be their best ever"", although later reviewers such as AllMusic noted that ""the magical chemistry that made such albums as Paranoid and Volume 4 so special was beginning to disintegrate"". 
Sabotage reached the top 20 in both the US and the UK, but was the band's first release not to achieve Platinum status in the US, only achieving Gold certification. Although the album's only single ""Am I Going Insane (Radio)"" failed to chart, Sabotage features fan favourites such as ""Hole in the Sky"", and ""Symptom of the Universe"". Black Sabbath toured in support of Sabotage with openers Kiss, but were forced to cut the tour short in November 1975, following a motorcycle accident in which Osbourne ruptured a muscle in his back. In December 1975, the band's record companies released a Greatest hits album without input from the band, titled We Sold Our Soul for Rock 'n' Roll. The album charted throughout 1976, eventually selling two million copies in the US. 

Technical Ecstasy and Never Say Die! (1976-79):

Black Sabbath began work for their next album at Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida, in June 1976. To expand their sound, the band added keyboard player Gerry Woodruffe, who also had appeared to a lesser extent on Sabotage. During the recording of Technical Ecstasy, Osbourne admits that he began losing interest in Black Sabbath and began to consider the possibility of working with other musicians. Recording of Technical Ecstasy was difficult; by the time the album was completed Osbourne was admitted to Stafford County Asylum in Britain. It was released on 25 September 1976 to mixed reviews, and (for the first time) later music critics gave the album less favourable retrospective reviews; two decades after its release AllMusic gave the album two stars, and noted that the band was ""unravelling at an alarming rate"". The album featured less of the doomy, ominous sound of previous efforts, and incorporated more synthesisers and uptempo rock songs. Technical Ecstasy failed to reach the top 50 in the US, and was the band's second consecutive release not to achieve platinum status, although it was later certified gold in 1997. The album included ""Dirty Women"", which remains a live staple, as well as Ward's first lead vocal on the song ""It's Alright"". Touring in support of Technical Ecstasy began in November 1976, with openers Boston and Ted Nugent in the US, and completed in Europe with AC/DC in April 1977. 
In late 1977, while in rehearsal for their next album, and just days before the band was set to enter the studio, Osbourne abruptly quit the band. Iommi called vocalist Dave Walker, a longtime friend of the band, who had previously been a member of Fleetwood Mac and Savoy Brown, and informed him that Osbourne had left the band. Walker, who was at that time fronting a band called Mistress, flew to Birmingham from California in late 1977 to write material and rehearse with Black Sabbath. On 8 January 1978, Black Sabbath made their only live performance with Walker on vocals, playing an early version of the song ""Junior's Eyes"" on the BBC Television program ""Look! Hear!"". Walker later recalled that while in Birmingham he had bumped into Osbourne in a pub and came to the conclusion that Osbourne wasn't fully committed to leaving Black Sabbath. ""The last Sabbath albums were just very depressing for me"", Osbourne said. ""I was doing it for the sake of what we could get out of the record company, just to get fat on beer and put a record out."" Walker has said that he wrote a lot of lyrics during his brief time in the band but none of them were ever used. If any recordings of this version of the band other than the ""Look! Hear!"" footage still exist, Walker says that he is not aware of them. 
Osbourne initially set out to form a solo project featuring ex-Dirty tricks members John Frazer-Binnie, Terry Horbury, and Andy Bierne. As the new band were in rehearsals in January 1978, Osbourne had a change of heart and rejoined Black Sabbath. ""Three days before we were due to go into the studio, Ozzy wanted to come back to the band,"" Iommi explained. ""He wouldn't sing any of the stuff we'd written with the other guy (Walker), so it made it very difficult. We went into the studio with basically no songs. We'd write in the morning so we could rehearse and record at night. It was so difficult, like a conveyor belt, because you couldn't get time to reflect on stuff. 'Is this right? Is this working properly?' It was very difficult for me to come up with the ideas and putting them together that quick."" 
The band spent five months at Sounds Interchange Studios in Toronto, Canada, writing and recording what would become Never Say Die!. ""It took quite a long time,"" Iommi said. ""We were getting really drugged out, doing a lot of dope. We'd go down to the sessions, and have to pack up because we were too stoned, we'd have to stop. Nobody could get anything right, we were all over the place, everybody's playing a different thing. We'd go back and sleep it off, and try again the next day."" The album was released in September 1978, reaching number twelve in the UK, and number 69 in the US. Press response was unfavourable and did not improve over time with Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic stating two decades after its release that the album's ""unfocused songs perfectly reflected the band's tense personnel problems and drug abuse."" The album featured the singles ""Never Say Die"" and ""Hard Road"", both of which cracked the top 40 in the UK. The band also made their second appearance on Top of the Pops, performing ""Never Say Die"". It took nearly 20 years for the album to be certified Gold in the US. 
Touring in support of Never Say Die! began in May 1978 with openers Van Halen. Reviewers called Black Sabbath's performance ""tired and uninspired"", a stark contrast to the ""youthful"" performance of Van Halen, who were touring the world for the first time. The band filmed a performance at the Hammersmith Odeon in June 1978, which was later released on DVD as Never Say Die. The final show of the tour, and Osbourne's last appearance with the band (until later reunions) was in Albuquerque, New Mexico on 11 December. 
Following the tour, Black Sabbath returned to Los Angeles and again rented a house in Bel Air, where they spent nearly a year working on new material for the next album. The entire band were abusing drugs and alcohol, but Iommi says Osbourne ""was on a totally different level altogether"". The band would come up with new song ideas but Osbourne showed little interest and would refuse to sing them. Pressure from the record label and frustrations with Osbourne's lack of input coming to a head, Iommi made the decision to fire Osbourne in 1979. Iommi believed the only options available were to fire Osbourne or break the band up completely. ""At that time, Ozzy had come to an end"", Iommi said. ""We were all doing a lot of drugs, a lot of coke, a lot of everything, and Ozzy was getting drunk so much at the time. We were supposed to be rehearsing and nothing was happening. It was like 'Rehearse today? No, we'll do it tomorrow.' It really got so bad that we didn't do anything. It just fizzled out."" Drummer Ward, who was close with Osbourne, was chosen by Tony to break the news to the singer on 27 April 1979. ""I hope I was professional, I might not have been, actually. When I'm drunk I am horrible, I am horrid,"" Ward said. ""Alcohol was definitely one of the most damaging things to Black Sabbath. We were destined to destroy each other. The band were toxic, very toxic."" 

Heaven and Hell and Mob Rules (1979-82):
Sharon Arden (later Sharon Osbourne), daughter of Black Sabbath manager Don Arden, suggested former Rainbow vocalist Ronnie James Dio to replace Ozzy Osbourne in 1979. Don Arden was at this point still trying to convince Osbourne to rejoin the band, as he viewed the original line-up as the most profitable. Dio officially joined in June, and the band began writing their next album. With a notably different vocal style from Osbourne's, Dio's addition to the band marked a change in Black Sabbath's sound. ""They were totally different altogether"", Iommi explains. ""Not only voice-wise, but attitude-wise. Ozzy was a great showman, but when Dio came in, it was a different attitude, a different voice and a different musical approach, as far as vocals. Dio would sing across the riff, whereas Ozzy would follow the riff, like in ""Iron Man"". Ronnie came in and gave us another angle on writing."" 
Geezer Butler temporarily left the band in September 1979 for personal reasons. According to Dio, the band initially hired Craig Gruber (with whom Dio had previously played while in Elf) on bass to assist with writing the new album. Gruber was soon replaced by Geoff Nicholls of Quartz. The new line-up returned to Criteria Studios in November to begin recording work, with Butler returning to the band in January 1980, and Nicholls moving to keyboards. Produced by Martin Birch, Heaven and Hell was released on 25 April 1980, to critical acclaim. Over a decade after its release Allmusic said the album was ""one of Sabbath's finest records, the band sounds reborn and re-energised throughout"".Heaven and Hell peaked at number 9 in the UK, and number 28 in the US, the band's highest charting album since Sabotage. The album eventually sold a million copies in the US, and the band embarked on an extensive world tour, making their first live appearance with Dio in Germany on 17 April 1980. 

Black Sabbath toured the US throughout 1980 with Blue Öyster Cult on the ""Black and Blue"" tour, with a show at Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, New York filmed and released theatrically in 1981 as Black and Blue. On 26 July 1980, the band played to 75,000 fans at a sold-out Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum with Journey, Cheap Trick, and Molly Hatchet. The next day, the band appeared at the 1980 Day on the Green at Oakland Coliseum. While on tour, Black Sabbath's former label in England issued a live album culled from a seven-year-old performance, titled Live at Last without any input from the band. The album reached number five on the British charts, and saw the re-release of ""Paranoid"" as a single, which reached the top 20. 
On 18 August 1980, after a show in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Ward quit the band. ""It was intolerable for me to get on the stage without Ozzy. And I drank 24 hours a day, my alcoholism accelerated"". Geezer Butler stated that after the show, Ward came in drunk, talking about the things where ""He might as well be a Martian"". Ward then got angry, and decided to pack his things, and get on a bus to leave. The group then brought in drummer Vinny Appice to replace Ward. 

The band completed the Heaven and Hell world tour in February 1981, and returned to the studio to begin work on their next album. Black Sabbath's second studio album produced by Martin Birch and featuring Ronnie James Dio as vocalist Mob Rules was released in October 1981, to be well received by fans, but less so by the critics. Rolling Stone reviewer J. D. Considine gave the album one star, claiming ""Mob Rules finds the band as dull-witted and flatulent as ever"". Like most of the band's earlier work, time helped to improve the opinions of the music press, a decade after its release, Allmusic's Eduardo Rivadavia called Mob Rules ""a magnificent record"". The album was certified gold, and reached the top 20 on the UK charts. The album's title track ""The Mob Rules"", which was recorded at John Lennon's old house in England, also featured in the 1981 animated film Heavy Metal, although the film version is an alternate take, and differs from the album version. 
Unhappy with the quality of 1980's Live at Last, the band recorded another live album--titled Live Evil--during the Mob Rules world tour, across the United States in Dallas, San Antonio, and Seattle, in 1982. During the mixing process for the album, Iommi and Butler had a falling out with Dio. Misinformed by their then-current mixing engineer, Iommi and Butler accused Dio of sneaking into the studio at night to raise the volume of his vocals. In addition, Dio was not satisfied with the pictures of him in the artwork. ""Ronnie wanted more say in things,"" Iommi said. ""And Geezer would get upset with him and that is where the rot set in. Live Evil is when it all fell apart. Ronnie wanted to do more of his own thing, and the engineer we were using at the time in the studio didn't know what to do, because Ronnie was telling him one thing and we were telling him another. At the end of the day, we just said, 'That's it, the band is over'"". ""When it comes time for the vocal, nobody tells me what to do. Nobody! Because they're not as good as me, so I do what I want to do,"" Dio later said. ""I refuse to listen to Live Evil, because there are too many problems. If you look at the credits, the vocals and drums are listed off to the side. Open up the album and see how many pictures there are of Tony, and how many there are of me and Vinny"". 
Ronnie James Dio left Black Sabbath in November 1982 to start his own band, and took drummer Vinny Appice with him. Live Evil was released in January 1983, but was overshadowed by Ozzy Osbourne's platinum selling album Speak of the Devil. 

Born Again (1983-84):
The two original members left, Tony Iommi and Geezer Butler, began auditioning new singers for the band's next release. Samson's Nicky Moore, and Lone Star's John Sloman were considered. The band settled on former Deep Purple vocalist Ian Gillan to replace Ronnie James Dio in December 1982. While the project was not initially set to be called Black Sabbath, pressures from the record label forced the group to retain the name. The band entered The Manor Studios in Shipton-on-Cherwell, Oxfordshire, in June 1983 with a returned and newly sober Bill Ward on drums.Born Again was panned upon release by critics. Despite the negative reception of the album, it reached number four on the UK charts, and number 39 in the US. Even a decade after its release Allmusic's Eduardo Rivadavia called the album ""dreadful"", noting that ""Gillan's bluesy style and humorous lyrics were completely incompatible with the lords of doom and gloom"". 
Although he performed on the album, drummer Ward was unable to tour because of the pressures of the road, and quit the band after the commencement of the Born Again album. ""I fell apart with the idea of touring,"" Ward later said. ""I got so much fear behind touring, I didn't talk about the fear, I drank behind the fear instead and that was a big mistake."" Ward was replaced by former Electric Light Orchestra drummer Bev Bevan for the Born Again '83 -'84 world tour, (often unofficially referred to as the 'Feigh Death Sabbath '83 - '84' World Tour) which began in Europe with Diamond Head, and later in the US with Quiet Riot and Night Ranger. The band headlined the 1983 Reading Festival in England, adding the Deep Purple song ""Smoke on the Water"" to their set list. 
The tour in support of Born Again included a giant set of the Stonehenge monument. In a move that would be later parodied in the mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap, the band made a mistake in ordering the set piece. As Geezer Butler later explained: 

We had Sharon Osbourne's dad, Don Arden, managing us. He came up with the idea of having the stage set be Stonehenge. He wrote the dimensions down and gave it to our tour manager. He wrote it down in metres but he meant to write it down in feet. The people who made it saw fifteen metres instead of fifteen feet. It was 45 feet high and it wouldn't fit on any stage anywhere so we just had to leave it in the storage area. It cost a fortune to make but there was not a building on earth that you could fit it into. 

Hiatus and Seventh Star (1984-86):
Following the completion of the Born Again tour in March 1984, vocalist Ian Gillan left Black Sabbath to re-join Deep Purple, which was reforming after a long hiatus. Bevan left at the same time, and Gillan remarked that he and Bevan were made to feel like ""hired help"" by Iommi. The band then recruited an unknown Los Angeles vocalist named David Donato. The new line-up wrote and rehearsed throughout 1984, and eventually recorded a demo with producer Bob Ezrin in October. Unhappy with the results, the band parted ways with Donato shortly after. Disillusioned with the band's revolving line-up, bassist Geezer Butler quit Black Sabbath in November 1984 to form a solo band. ""When Ian Gillan took over that was the end of it for me"", Butler later said. ""I thought it was just a joke and I just totally left. When we got together with Gillan it was not supposed to be a Black Sabbath album. After we had done the album we gave it to Warner Bros. and they said they were going to put it out as a Black Sabbath album and we didn't have a leg to stand on. I got really disillusioned with it and Gillan was really pissed off about it. That lasted one album and one tour and then that was it."" 
Following Butler's exit, sole remaining original member Tony Iommi put Black Sabbath on hiatus, and began work on a solo album with long-time Sabbath keyboardist Geoff Nicholls. While working on new material, the original Black Sabbath line-up were offered a spot at Bob Geldof's Live Aid benefit concert; the band agreed, performing at the Philadelphia show, on 13 July 1985. The event marked the first time the original line-up appeared on stage since 1978, and also featured reunions of the Who and Led Zeppelin. Returning to his solo work, Iommi enlisted bassist Dave Spitz, drummer Eric Singer and initially intended to use multiple singers, including Rob Halford of Judas Priest, ex-Deep Purple and Trapeze vocalist Glenn Hughes, and ex-Black Sabbath vocalist Ronnie James Dio. This plan didn't work as he forecasted. ""We were going to use different vocalists on the album, guest vocalists, but it was so difficult getting it together and getting releases from their record companies. Glenn Hughes came along to sing on one track and we decided to use him on the whole album."" 
The band spent the remainder of the year in the studio, recording what would become Seventh Star. Warner Bros. refused to release the album as a Tony Iommi solo release, instead insisting on using the name Black Sabbath. Pressured by the band's manager, Don Arden, the two compromised and released the album as ""Black Sabbath featuring Tony Iommi"" in January 1986. ""It opened up a whole can of worms really,"" Iommi explained, ""because I think if we could have done it as a solo album, it would have been accepted a lot more.""Seventh Star, which sounded little like a Black Sabbath album, incorporated more hard rock elements popularised by the 1980s Sunset Strip hard rock scene, and was panned by the critics of the era, although later reviewers such as Allmusic gave the album favourable reviews, calling the album ""often misunderstood and underrated"". 
The new line-up rehearsed for six weeks preparing for a full world tour, although the band were eventually forced to use the Black Sabbath name. ""I was into the 'Tony Iommi project', but I wasn't into the Black Sabbath moniker,"" Hughes said. ""The idea of being in Black Sabbath didn't appeal to me whatsoever. Glenn Hughes singing in Black Sabbath is like James Brown singing in Metallica. It wasn't gonna work"". Just four days before the start of the tour, vocalist Glenn Hughes got into a bar fight with the band's production manager John Downing which splintered the singer's orbital bone. The injury interfered with Hughes' ability to sing, and the band brought in vocalist Ray Gillen to continue the tour with W.A.S.P. and Anthrax, although nearly half of the US dates would eventually be cancelled because of poor ticket sales. 
One vocalist whose status is disputed, both inside and outside Black Sabbath, is Christian evangelist and former Joshua frontman, Jeff Fenholt. Fenholt has insisted that he was a singer in Black Sabbath between January and May 1985. Tony Iommi has never confirmed this. Fenholt gives a detailed account of his time with Iommi and Sabbath in Garry Sharpe-Young's book Sabbath Bloody Sabbath: The Battle for Black Sabbath. 

The Eternal Idol, Headless Cross and Tyr (1986-90):
Black Sabbath began work on new material in October 1986 at Air Studios in Montserrat with producer Jeff Glixman. The recording was fraught with problems from the beginning, as Glixman left after the initial sessions to be replaced by producer Vic Coppersmith-Heaven. Bassist Dave Spitz quit over ""personal issues"", and ex-Rainbow and Ozzy Osbourne bassist Bob Daisley was brought in. Daisley re-recorded all of the bass tracks, and wrote the album's lyrics, but before the album was complete, he left to join Gary Moore's backing band, taking drummer Eric Singer with him. After problems with second producer Coppersmith-Heaven, the band returned to Morgan Studios in England in January 1987 to work with new producer Chris Tsangarides. While working in the UK, new vocalist Ray Gillen abruptly left Black Sabbath to form Blue Murder with John Sykes. The band enlisted ex-Alliance vocalist Tony Martin to re-record Gillen's tracks, and former Electric Light Orchestra drummer Bev Bevan to complete a few percussion overdubs. Before the release of the new album Black Sabbath accepted an offer to play six shows at Sun City, South Africa during the apartheid era. The band drew criticism from activists and artists involved with Artists United Against Apartheid, who had been boycotting South Africa since 1985. Drummer Bev Bevan refused to play the shows, and was replaced by Terry Chimes, formerly of the Clash. 
After nearly a year in production, The Eternal Idol was released on 8 December 1987 and ignored by contemporary reviewers. On-line internet era reviews were mixed. AllMusic said that ""Martin's powerful voice added new fire"" to the band, and the album contained ""some of Iommi's heaviest riffs in years.""Blender gave the album two stars, claiming the album was ""Black Sabbath in name only"". The album would stall at No. 66 in the UK, while peaking at 168 in the US. The band toured in support of Eternal Idol in Germany, Italy and for the first time, Greece. Unfortunately, in part because of a backlash from promoters over the South Africa incident, other European shows were cancelled. Bassist Dave Spitz left the band shortly before the tour, and was replaced by Jo Burt, formerly of Virginia Wolf. 
Following the poor commercial performance of The Eternal Idol, Black Sabbath were dropped by both Vertigo Records and Warner Bros. Records, and signed with I.R.S. Records. The band took time off in 1988, returning in August to begin work on their next album. As a result of the recording troubles with Eternal Idol, Tony Iommi opted to produce the band's next album himself. ""It was a completely new start"", Iommi said. ""I had to rethink the whole thing, and decided that we needed to build up some credibility again"". Iommi enlisted ex-Rainbow drummer Cozy Powell, long-time keyboardist Nicholls and session bassist Laurence Cottle, and rented a ""very cheap studio in England"". 
Black Sabbath released Headless Cross in April 1989, and it was also ignored by contemporary reviewers, although Allmusic contributor Eduardo Rivadavia gave the album four stars and called it ""the finest non-Ozzy or Dio Black Sabbath album"". Anchored by the number 62 charting single ""Headless Cross"", the album reached number 31 on the UK charts, and number 115 in the US.Queen guitarist Brian May, a good friend of Iommi's, played a guest solo on the song ""When Death Calls"". Following the album's release the band added touring bassist Neil Murray, formerly of Whitesnake, Gary Moore's backing band, and Vow Wow. 
The unsuccessful Headless Cross US tour began in May 1989 with openers Kingdom Come and Silent Rage, but because of poor ticket sales, the tour was cancelled after just eight shows. The European leg of the tour began in September, where the band were enjoying chart success. After a string of Japanese shows the band embarked on a 23 date Russian tour with Girlschool. Black Sabbath was one of the first bands to tour Russia, after Mikhail Gorbachev opened the country to western acts for the first time in 1989. 
The band returned to the studio in February 1990 to record Tyr, the follow-up to Headless Cross. While not technically a concept album, some of the album's lyrical themes are loosely based on Norse mythology.Tyr was released on 6 August 1990, reaching number 24 on the UK albums chart, but was the first Black Sabbath release not to break the Billboard 200 in the US. The album would receive mixed internet-era reviews, with Allmusic noting that the band ""mix myth with metal in a crushing display of musical synthesis"", while Blender gave the album just one star, claiming that ""Iommi continues to besmirch the Sabbath name with this unremarkable collection"". The band toured in support of Tyr with Circus of Power in Europe, but the final seven UK dates were cancelled because of poor ticket sales. For the first time in their career, the band's touring cycle did not include US dates. 

Dehumanizer (1990-92):

While on his own Lock Up the Wolves US tour in August 1990, former Black Sabbath vocalist Ronnie James Dio was joined on stage at the Roy Wilkins Auditorium by former Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler to perform ""Neon Knights"". Following the show, the two expressed interest in rejoining Black Sabbath. Butler convinced Iommi, who in turn broke up the current line-up, dismissing vocalist Tony Martin and bassist Neil Murray. ""I do regret that in a lot of ways"", Iommi said. ""We were at a good point then. We decided to reunite with Dio and I don't even know why, really. There's the financial aspect, but that wasn't it. I seemed to think maybe we could recapture something we had"". 
Ronnie James Dio and Geezer Butler joined Tony Iommi and Cozy Powell in autumn of 1990 to begin working on the next Black Sabbath release. While rehearsing in November, Powell suffered a broken hip when his horse died, falling on the drummer's legs. Unable to complete work on the album, Powell was replaced by former drummer Vinny Appice, reuniting the Mob Rules era line-up, and the band entered the studio with producer Reinhold Mack. The year-long recording process was plagued with problems, primarily stemming from writing tension between Iommi and Dio. Some songs were re-written multiple times. ""Dehumanizer took a long time, it was just hard work"", Iommi said. ""We took too long on it, that album cost us a million dollars, which is bloody ridiculous"". Dio later recalled the album as difficult, but worth the effort. ""It was something we had to really wring out of ourselves, but I think that's why it works"", he said. ""Sometimes you need that kind of tension, or else you end up making the Christmas album"". 
The resulting album, Dehumanizer was released on 22 June 1992. In the US, the album was released on 30 June 1992 by Reprise Records, as Ronnie James Dio and his namesake band were still under contract with the label at the time. While the album received mixed reviews, it was the band's biggest commercial success in a decade. Anchored by the top 40 rock radio single ""TV Crimes"", the album peaked at number 44 on the Billboard 200. The album also featured the song ""Time Machine"", a version of which had been recorded for the 1992 film Wayne's World. Additionally, the perception by many fans of a return of some semblance of the ""real"" Black Sabbath provided the band with some much needed momentum. 
Black Sabbath began touring in support of Dehumanizer in July 1992 with Testament, Danzig, Prong, and Exodus. While on tour, former vocalist Ozzy Osbourne announced his first retirement, and invited Black Sabbath to open for his solo band at the final two shows of his No More Tours tour in Costa Mesa, California. The band agreed, aside from vocalist Ronnie James Dio, who told Iommi in no uncertain terms ""I'm not doing that. I'm not supporting a clown."" Dio spoke of the situation in an interview years later: 

I was told in the middle of the tour that we would be opening for Ozzy in Los Angeles. And I said, ""No. Sorry, I have more pride than that."" A lot of bad things were being said from camp to camp, and it created this horrible schism. So by the band agreeing to play the shows in L.A. with Ozzy, that, to me, spelled out reunion. And that obviously meant the doom of that particular project. 

Dio quit Black Sabbath following a show in Oakland, California on 13 November 1992, one night before the band were set to appear at Osbourne's retirement show. Judas Priest vocalist Rob Halford stepped in at the last minute, performing two nights with the band. Iommi and Butler also joined Osbourne and former drummer Ward on stage for the first time since 1985's Live Aid concert, performing a brief set of Black Sabbath songs. 

Cross Purposes and Forbidden (1993-96):
Drummer Vinny Appice left the band following the reunion show to join Ronnie James Dio's solo band, later appearing on Dio's Strange Highways and Angry Machines. Iommi and Butler enlisted former Rainbow drummer Bobby Rondinelli, and reinstated former vocalist Tony Martin. The band returned to the studio to work on new material, although the project was not originally intended to be released under the Black Sabbath name. As Geezer Butler explains: 

It wasn't even supposed to be a Sabbath album; I wouldn't have even done it under the pretence of Sabbath. That was the time when the original band were talking about getting back together for a reunion tour. Tony and myself just went in with a couple of people, did an album just to have, while the reunion tour was (supposedly) going on. It was like an Iommi/Butler project album. 

Under pressure from their record label, the band released their seventeenth studio album, Cross Purposes, on 8 February 1994, under the Black Sabbath name. The album received mixed reviews, with Blender giving the album two stars, calling Soundgarden's 1994 album Superunknown ""a far better Sabbath album than this by-the-numbers potboiler"". Allmusic's Bradley Torreano called Cross Purposes ""the first album since Born Again that actually sounds like a real Sabbath record"". The album just missed the Top 40 in the UK reaching number 41, and also reached 122 on the Billboard 200 in the US. Cross Purposes contained the song ""Evil Eye"", which was co-written by Van Halen guitarist Eddie Van Halen, although uncredited because of record label restrictions. Touring in support of Cross Purposes began in February with Morbid Angel and Motörhead in the US. The band filmed a live performance at the Hammersmith Apollo on 13 April 1994, which was released on VHS accompanied by a CD, titled Cross Purposes Live. After the European tour with Cathedral and Godspeed in June 1994, drummer Bobby Rondinelli quit the band and was replaced by original Black Sabbath drummer Ward for five shows in South America. 
Following the touring cycle for Cross Purposes, bassist Geezer Butler quit the band for the second time. ""I finally got totally disillusioned with the last Sabbath album, and I much preferred the stuff I was writing to the stuff Sabbath were doing"". Butler formed a solo project called GZR, and released Plastic Planet in 1995. The album contained the song ""Giving Up the Ghost"", which was critical of Tony Iommi for carrying on with the Black Sabbath name, with the lyrics: You plagiarised and parodied / the magic of our meaning / a legend in your own mind / left all your friends behind / you can't admit that you're wrong / the spirit is dead and gone (""I heard it's something about me ..."" said Iommi. ""I had the album given to me a while back. I played it once, then somebody else had it, so I haven't really paid any attention to the lyrics ... It's nice to see him doing his own thing - getting things off his chest. I don't want to get into a rift with Geezer. He's still a friend."" 
Following Butler's departure, newly returned drummer Ward once again left the band. Iommi reinstated former members Neil Murray on bass and Cozy Powell on drums, effectively reuniting the Tyr line-up. The band enlisted Body Count guitarist Ernie C to produce the new album, which was recorded in London in autumn of 1994. The album featured a guest vocal on ""Illusion of Power"" by Body Count vocalist Ice-T. The resulting Forbidden was released on 8 June 1995, but failed to chart in the US or the UK. The album was widely panned by critics; Allmusic's Bradley Torreano said ""with boring songs, awful production, and uninspired performances, this is easily avoidable for all but the most enthusiastic fan""; while Blender magazine called Forbidden ""an embarrassment ... the band's worst album"". 
Black Sabbath embarked on a world tour in July 1995 with openers Motörhead and Tiamat, but two months into the tour, drummer Cozy Powell left the band, citing health issues, and was replaced by former drummer Bobby Rondinelli. ""The members I had in the last lineup - Bobby Rondinelli, Neil Murray - they're great, great characters ..."" Iommi told Sabbath fanzine Southern Cross. ""That, for me, was an ideal lineup. I wasn't sure vocally what we should do, but Neil Murray and Bobby Rondinelli I really got on well with."" 
After completing Asian dates in December 1995, Tony Iommi put the band on hiatus, and began work on a solo album with former Black Sabbath vocalist Glenn Hughes, and former Judas Priest drummer Dave Holland. The album was not officially released following its completion, although a widely traded bootleg called Eighth Star surfaced soon after. The album was officially released in 2004 as The 1996 DEP Sessions, with Holland's drums re-recorded by session drummer Jimmy Copley. 
In 1997, Tony Iommi disbanded the current line-up to officially reunite with Ozzy Osbourne and the original Black Sabbath line-up. Vocalist Tony Martin claimed that an original line-up reunion had been in the works since the band's brief reunion at Ozzy Osbourne's 1992 Costa Mesa show, and that the band released subsequent albums to fulfill their record contract with I.R.S. Records. Martin later recalled Forbidden as a ""filler album that got the band out of the label deal, rid of the singer, and into the reunion. However I wasn't privy to that information at the time"".I.R.S. Records released a compilation album in 1996 to fulfill the band's contract, titled The Sabbath Stones, which featured songs from Born Again to Forbidden. 

Reunion (1997-2006):

In the summer of 1997, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Ozzy Osbourne officially reunited to co-headline the Ozzfest festival tour alongside Osbourne's solo band. The line-up featured Osbourne's drummer Mike Bordin filling in for Ward, who was unable to participate because of previous commitments with his solo project, the Bill Ward Band. In December 1997, the group was joined by Ward, marking the first reunion of the original four members since Osbourne's 1992 ""retirement show"". The original line-up recorded two shows at the Birmingham NEC, which were released as the double live album Reunion on 20 October 1998. Reunion reached number eleven on the Billboard 200, and went platinum in the US. The album spawned the single ""Iron Man"", which won Black Sabbath their first Grammy award in 2000 for Best Metal Performance, 30 years after the song was originally released. Reunion also featured two new studio tracks, ""Psycho Man"" and ""Selling My Soul"", both of which cracked the top 20 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. 
Shortly before the band embarked on a European tour in the summer of 1998, Ward suffered a heart attack and was temporarily replaced by former drummer Vinny Appice. Ward returned in time for the US tour with openers Pantera, which began in January 1999 and continued through the summer, headlining the annual Ozzfest tour. Following the Ozzfest appearances, the band was put on hiatus while members worked on solo material. Tony Iommi released his first official solo album, Iommi, in 2000, while Osbourne continued work on his next solo release, Down to Earth. 
Black Sabbath returned to the studio to work on new material with all four original members and producer Rick Rubin in the spring of 2001, but the sessions were halted when Osbourne was called away to finish tracks for his solo album in the summer of 2001. ""It just came to an end"", Iommi said. ""We didn't go any further, and it's a shame because the songs were really good"". Iommi commented on the difficulty getting all of the band members together to work on material: 

It's quite different recording now. We've all done so much in between. In the early days there was no mobile phone ringing every five seconds. When we first started, we had nothing. We all worked for the same thing. Now everybody has done so many other things. It's great fun and we all have a good chat, but it's just different, trying to put an album together. 

In March 2002, Ozzy Osbourne's Emmy winning reality TV show The Osbournes debuted on MTV, and quickly became a worldwide hit. The show introduced Osbourne to a broader audience and to capitalise, the band's back catalogue label, Sanctuary Records released a double live album Past Lives, which featured concert material recorded in the 1970s, including the previously unofficial Live at Last album. The band remained on hiatus until the summer of 2004 when they returned to headline Ozzfest 2004 and 2005. In November 2005, Black Sabbath were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame, and in March 2006, after eleven years of eligibility, the band were inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. At the awards ceremony Metallica played two Black Sabbath songs, ""Hole in the Sky"" and ""Iron Man"" in tribute to the band. 

The Dio Years and Heaven & Hell (2006-10):

While Ozzy Osbourne was working on new solo album material in 2006, Rhino Records released Black Sabbath: The Dio Years, a compilation of songs culled from the four Black Sabbath releases featuring Ronnie James Dio. For the release, Iommi, Butler, Dio and Appice reunited to write and record three new songs as Black Sabbath. The Dio Years was released on 3 April 2007, reaching number 54 on the Billboard 200, while the single ""The Devil Cried"" reached number 37 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Pleased with the results, Iommi and Dio decided to reunite the Heaven and Hell era line-up for a world tour. While the line-up of Osbourne, Butler, Iommi and Ward were still officially called Black Sabbath, the new line-up opted to call themselves Heaven & Hell, after the album of the same name, to avoid confusion. When asked about the name of the group, Iommi stated ""it really is Black Sabbath, whatever we do... so everyone knows what they're getting and so people won't expect to hear 'Iron Man' and all those songs. We've done them for so many years, it's nice to do just all the stuff we did with Ronnie again."" Ward was initially set to participate, but dropped out before the tour began due to musical differences with ""a couple of the band members"". He was replaced by former drummer Vinny Appice, effectively reuniting the line-up that had featured on the Mob Rules and Dehumanizer albums. 
Heaven & Hell toured the US with openers Megadeth and Machine Head, and recorded a live album and DVD in New York on 30 March 2007, titled Live from Radio City Music Hall. In November 2007, Dio confirmed that the band had plans to record a new studio album, which was recorded in the following year. In April 2008 the band announced the upcoming release of a new box set and their participation in the Metal Masters Tour, alongside Judas Priest, Motörhead and Testament. The box set, The Rules of Hell, featuring remastered versions of all the Dio fronted Black Sabbath albums, was supported by the Metal Masters Tour. In 2009, the band announced the name of their debut studio album, The Devil You Know, released on 28 April. 
On 26 May 2009 Osbourne filed suit in a federal court in New York against Iommi alleging that he illegally claimed the band name. Iommi noted that he has been the only constant band member for its full 41-year career, and that his bandmates relinquished their rights to the name in the 1980s, therefore claiming more rights to the name of the band. Although, in the suit, Osbourne was seeking 50% ownership of the trademark, he said that he hoped the proceedings would lead to equal ownership among the four original members. 
In March 2010, Black Sabbath announced that along with Metallica they would be releasing a limited edition single together to celebrate Record Store Day. It was released on 17 April 2010. 
Ronnie James Dio died on 16 May 2010 from stomach cancer. In June 2010, the legal battle between Ozzy Osbourne and Tony Iommi over the trademarking of the Black Sabbath name ended, but the terms of the settlement have not been disclosed. 

Reunion and 13 (2010-2014):

In a January 2010 interview while promoting his biography I Am Ozzy, Osbourne stated that although he would not rule it out, he was doubtful there would be a reunion with all four original members of the band. Osbourne stated: ""I'm not gonna say I've written it out forever, but right now I don't think there's any chance. But who knows what the future holds for me? If it's my destiny, fine."" In July, Butler said that there would be no reunion in 2011, as Osbourne was already committed to touring with his solo band. However by that August they had already met up to rehearse together, and continued to do so through the autumn. 
On 11 November 2011, Iommi, Butler, Osbourne, and Ward announced that they were reuniting to record a new album with a full tour in support beginning in 2012. Guitarist Iommi was diagnosed with lymphoma on 9 January 2012, which forced the band to cancel all but two shows (Download Festival, and Lollapalooza Festival) of a previously booked European tour. It was later announced that an intimate show would be played in their hometown Birmingham. It was the first concert since the reunion and the only indoors concerts that year. In February 2012, drummer Ward announced that he would not participate further in the band's reunion until he was offered a ""signable contract"". 
On 21 May 2012, at the O2 Academy in Birmingham, Black Sabbath played their first concert since 2005, with Tommy Clufetos playing the drums. In June, they performed at Download Festival, followed by the last concert of the short tour at Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago. Later that month, the band started recording an album. 

On 13 January 2013, the band announced that the album would be released in June under the title 13. Brad Wilk of Rage Against the Machine was chosen as the drummer, and Rick Rubin was chosen as the producer.Mixing of the album commenced in February. On 12 April 2013, the band released the album's track listing. The standard version of the album features eight new tracks, and the deluxe version features three bonus tracks. 
The band's first single from 13, ""God Is Dead?"", was released on 19 April 2013. On 20 April 2013, Black Sabbath commenced their first Australia/New Zealand tour in 40 years, to be followed by a major North American Tour in Summer 2013. The second single of the album, ""End of the Beginning"", debuted on 15 May in a CSI: Crime Scene Investigation episode, where all three members appeared. In June 2013, 13 topped both the UK Albums Chart and the US Billboard 200. ""God Is Dead?"" earned Black Sabbath their first Grammy Award in 14 years for Best Metal Performance in 2014. 
In July 2013, Black Sabbath embarked on a North American Tour (for the first time since July 2001), followed by a Latin American tour in October 2013. In November 2013, the band started their European tour which lasted until December 2013. In March and April 2014, they made 12 stops in North America (mostly in Canada) as the second leg of their North American Tour before embarking in June 2014 on the second leg of their European tour, which ended with a concert at London's Hyde Park. 

Final album and tour (2014-present):
On 29 September 2014, vocalist Ozzy Osbourne told Metal Hammer that Black Sabbath would begin work on their twentieth studio album in early 2015 with producer Rick Rubin. The band will promote the album with a final tour in 2016. In an April 2015 interview, however, Osbourne said that these plans ""could change"", and added, ""We all live in different countries and some of them want to work and some of them don't want to, I believe. But we are going to do another tour together."" 

Musical style:
Black Sabbath are a heavy metal band, whose music has also been described as psychedelic rock,blues rock, hard rock, progressive rock, proto-progressive metal, and acid rock. The band have also been cited as a key influence on genres including stoner rock,doom metal, and sludge metal. 
Early on Black Sabbath were influenced by the Beatles, Cream, Fleetwood Mac, John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers, and Jethro Tull. 
Although Black Sabbath have gone through many line-ups and stylistic changes, their core sound focuses on ominous lyrics and doomy music, often making use of the musical tritone, also called the ""devil's interval"". While their Ozzy-era albums such as Sabbath Bloody Sabbath had slight compositional similarities to the progressive rock genre that was growing in popularity at the time, standing in stark contrast to popular music of the early 1970s Black Sabbath's dark sound was dismissed by rock critics of the era. Much like many of their early heavy metal contemporaries, the band received virtually no airplay on rock radio. 
As the band's primary songwriter, Tony Iommi wrote the majority of Black Sabbath's music, while Osbourne would write vocal melodies, and bassist Geezer Butler would write lyrics. The process was sometimes frustrating for Iommi, who often felt pressured to come up with new material. ""If I didn't come up with anything, nobody would do anything."" On Iommi's influence, Osbourne later said: 

Black Sabbath never used to write a structured song. There'd be a long intro that would go into a jazz piece, then go all folky ... and it worked. Tony Iommi--and I have said this a zillion times--should be up there with the greats. He can pick up a guitar, play a riff, and you say, 'He's gotta be out now, he can't top that.' Then you come back, and I bet you a billion dollars, he'd come up with a riff that'd knock your fucking socks off. 

Beginning with their third album, Master of Reality, Black Sabbath began to feature tuned-down guitars. In 1965, before forming Black Sabbath, guitarist Tony Iommi suffered an accident while working in a sheet metal factory, losing the tips of two fingers on his right hand. Iommi almost gave up music, but was urged by the factory manager to listen to Django Reinhardt, a jazz guitarist who lost the use of two fingers. Inspired by Reinhardt, Iommi created two thimbles made of plastic and leather to cap off his missing fingertips. The guitarist began using lighter strings, and detuning his guitar, to better grip the strings with his prosthesis. Early in the band's history Iommi experimented with different dropped tunings, including C♯ tuning, or 3 semitones down, before settling on E♭/D♯ tuning, or a half-step down from standard tuning. 

Legacy:
Black Sabbath has sold over 70 million records worldwide, including a RIAA-certified 15 million in the US. They are one of the most influential heavy metal bands of all time. The band helped to create the genre with ground-breaking releases such as Paranoid, an album that Rolling Stone magazine said ""changed music forever"", and called the band ""the Beatles of heavy metal"".Time Magazine called Paranoid ""the birthplace of heavy metal"", placing it in their Top 100 Albums of All Time.Rolling Stone magazine ranked Black Sabbath number 85 in their list of the ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time. MTV placed Black Sabbath at number one on their Top Ten Heavy Metal Bands and VH1 placed them at number two on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. VH1 ranked Black Sabbath's ""Iron Man"" the number one song on their 40 Greatest Metal Songs countdown. Allmusic's William Ruhlmann said: 

""Black Sabbath has been so influential in the development of heavy metal rock music as to be a defining force in the style. The group took the blues-rock sound of late '60s acts like Cream, Blue Cheer, and Vanilla Fudge to its logical conclusion, slowing the tempo, accentuating the bass, and emphasising screaming guitar solos and howled vocals full of lyrics expressing mental anguish and macabre fantasies. If their predecessors clearly came out of an electrified blues tradition, Black Sabbath took that tradition in a new direction, and in so doing helped give birth to a musical style that continued to attract millions of fans decades later."" 

According to Rolling Stone‍‍ '​‍s Holly George-Warren, ""Black Sabbath was the heavy metal king of the 70s."" Although initially ""despised by rock critics and ignored by radio programmers"", the group sold more than 8 million albums by the end of that decade. 

Influence and innovation:
Black Sabbath have influenced many acts including Iron Maiden,Slayer,Metallica,Nirvana,Korn,Mayhem,Venom, Judas Priest,Guns N' Roses,Soundgarden,Body Count,Alice in Chains,Anthrax,Disturbed,Death,Opeth,Pantera,Megadeth,the Smashing Pumpkins,Slipknot,Foo Fighters,Fear Factory,Candlemass,Godsmack, and Van Halen. Two gold selling tribute albums have been released, Nativity in Black Volume 1 & 2, including covers by Sepultura, White Zombie, Type O Negative, Faith No More, Machine Head, Primus, Raven Lord, System of a Down, and Monster Magnet. 
Metallica's Lars Ulrich, who, along with bandmate James Hetfield inducted Black Sabbath into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006, said ""Black Sabbath is and always will be synonymous with heavy metal"", while Hetfield said ""Sabbath got me started on all that evil-sounding shit, and it's stuck with me. Tony Iommi is the king of the heavy riff."" Ex-Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash said of the Paranoid album: ""There's just something about that whole record that, when you're a kid and you're turned onto it, it's like a whole different world. It just opens up your mind to another dimension ...Paranoid is the whole Sabbath experience; very indicative of what Sabbath meant at the time. Tony's playing style-- doesn't matter whether it's off Paranoid or if it's off Heaven and Hell-- it's very distinctive.""Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian said ""I always get the question in every interview I do, 'What are your top five metal albums?' I make it easy for myself and always say the first five Sabbath albums."" 
Lamb of God's Chris Adler said: ""If anybody who plays heavy metal says that they weren't influenced by Black Sabbath's music, then I think that they're lying to you. I think all heavy metal music was, in some way, influenced by what Black Sabbath did."" Judas Priest vocalist Rob Halford commented: ""They were and still are a groundbreaking band..you can put on the first Black Sabbath album and it still sounds as fresh today as it did 30-odd years ago. And that's because great music has a timeless ability: To me, Sabbath are in the same league as the Beatles or Mozart. They're on the leading edge of something extraordinary."" On Black Sabbath's standing, Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello states: ""The heaviest, scariest, coolest riffs and the apocalyptic Ozzy wail are without peer. You can hear the despair and menace of the working-class Birmingham streets they came from in every kick-ass, evil groove. Their arrival ground hippy, flower-power psychedelia to a pulp and set the standard for all heavy bands to come.""Phil Anselmo of Pantera and Down stated that ""Only a fool would leave out what Black Sabbath brought to the heavy metal genre"". 
According to Tracii Guns of L.A. Guns and former member of Guns N' Roses, the main riff of ""Paradise City"" by Guns N' Roses, from Appetite for Destruction (1987), was influenced by the song ""Zero the Hero"" from the Born Again album.King Diamond guitarist Andy LaRocque affirmed that the clean guitar part of ""Sleepless Nights"" from Conspiracy (1989) is inspired by Tony Iommi's playing on Never Say Die!. 
In addition to being pioneers of heavy metal, they also have been credited for laying the foundations for heavy metal subgenres stoner rock,sludge metal,thrash metal,black metal and doom metal as well as for alternative rock subgenre grunge. According to the critic Bob Gulla, the band's sound ""shows up in virtually all of grunge's most popular bands, including Nirvana, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains"". 
Tony Iommi has been credited as the pioneer of lighter gauge guitar strings. The tips of his fingers were severed in a steel factory, and while using thimbles (artificial finger tips) he found that standard guitar strings were too difficult to bend and play. He found that there was only one size of strings available, so after years with Sabbath he had strings custom made. 
Culturally, Black Sabbath have exerted a huge influence in both television and literature and have in many cases become synonymous with heavy metal. In the film Almost Famous, Lester Bangs gives the protagonist an assignment to cover the band (plot point one) with the immortal line: 'Give me 500 words on Black Sabbath'. Contemporary music and arts publication Trebuchet Magazine has put this to practice by asking all new writers to write a short piece (500 words) on Black Sabbath as a means of proving their creativity and voice on a well documented subject.

Wilco's lineup has changed frequently, with only singer Jeff Tweedy and bassist John Stirratt remaining from the original incarnation. The other current members are guitarist Nels Cline, multi-instrumentalists Pat Sansone and Mikael Jorgensen, and drummer Glenn Kotche. Wilco has released e⃥i⃥g⃥h⃥t⃥ nine studio albums, a live double album, and three collaborations: two with Billy Bragg, and one with The Minus 5.  Wilco's music has been inspired by a wide variety of artists and styles, including Bill Fay and Television, and has in turn influenced music by The National and Cherry Ghost. The band continued in the alternative country of Uncle Tupelo on its debut album A.M. (1995), but has since introduced more experimental aspects to their music.  Wilco garnered media attention for its fourth album, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot (2002), and the controversy surrounding it. After the recording sessions were complete, reprise records rejected the album and dismissed Wilco from the label. As part of a buy-out deal, Reprise gave Wilco the rights to the album for free. After streaming Foxtrot on its website, Wilco sold the album to Nonesuch Records in 2002. Both record labels are subsidiaries of Warner Music Group, leading one critic to say that the album showed ""how screwed up the music business [was] in the early twenty-first century."" Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is Wilco's most successful release to date, selling over 590,000 copies. Wilco won two Grammy Awards for their fifth studio album, 2004's A Ghost is Born, including Best Alternative Music Album.  The I Might Songfacts reports that Wilco's eighth album, The Whole Love (2011), marked the first ever release on the band's own label dBpm.  Formation  Wilco was formed following the breakup of the influential alternative country music group Uncle Tupelo. Singer Jay Farrar quit the band in 1994 supposedly because of a soured relationship with co-singer Jeff Tweedy. Both Tweedy and Farrar sought to form bands immediately after the breakup. Tweedy was able to keep the entire Uncle Tupelo lineup sans Farrar, including bassist John Stirratt, drummer Ken Coomer, and multi-instrumentalist Max Johnston. The band was tempted to keep the Uncle Tupelo name, but ultimately decided to rename the band. The group named itself ""Wilco"" after the CB radio voice procedure for ""I Will Comply"". [N.B. this term originates in World War 2 Battle of Britain Fighter pilot slang for will co-operate, if not earlier in the Royal Air Force]  A.M. and Being There  After collaborating with Syd Straw on a cover version of the Ernest Tubb song, ""The T.b. Is Whipping Me"" (released in September 1994 on the Red Hot + Country compilation), Wilco began recording tracks for A.M., their first studio album, at Easley studio in June 1995. A demo tape from these recordings was sent to executives at reprise records, a subsidiary of Warner Brothers, and the label signed Tweedy to a contract. Although Tweedy stated that he wanted a more collaborative project than Uncle Tupelo, only his name appeared on the Reprise contract. Tweedy requested songwriting submissions from other members, but only one submission--John Stirratt's ""It's Just That Simple""--appeared on A.M.. It was the last song Wilco ever released that was solely written by a member besides Tweedy.  Stylistically similar to Uncle Tupelo, the music on A.M. was considered to be straightforward alternative country rock in what Tweedy later described as ""trying to tread some water with a perceived audience."" A.M. peaked at number twenty-seven on the Billboard Heatseekers chart, considerably lower than the debut album of Jay Farrar's new band, Son Volt. The album was met with modest reviews though it would rank thirty-fourth in the Village Voice's 1995 Pazz & Jop critics poll. Critically and commercially paling in comparison to the reception of Son Volt's album, the Wilco members perceived A.M. to be a failure. Shortly after the release of the album, multi-instrumentalist Jay Bennett joined the band, providing the band with a keyboardist and another guitarist.  Wilco made its live debut on November 17, 1994 to a capacity crowd at Cicero's Basement Bar in St. Louis, Missouri (the band was billed for the occasion as ""Black Shampoo"").  During the two hundred-date tour supporting A.M., Tweedy began to write songs for a second album. The lyrical theme of the songs reflected a relationship between musical artist and a listener; Tweedy chose this topic because he sought to eschew the alternative country fan base. Ken Coomer elaborated: ""The whole No Depression thing was funny to us because people seemed to forget that Jeff was a bigger punk-rock fan than a country fan. It led to things like us all switching instruments on 'Misunderstood,' where I'm playing guitar."" A number of songs were recorded with this theme, including ""Sunken Treasure"" and ""Hotel Arizona"", however, Wilco also recorded a number of songs in the style of A.M. Wilco named the album Being There after a Peter Sellers film of the same name. The band went through some personnel changes during the recording sessions. Max Johnston left the band because he felt that his role in the band had diminished in favor of Bennett; he had also been replaced by violinist Jesse Greene on one track because the band felt that Johnston was unable to play the part. Bob Egan of Freakwater briefly joined the band in the studio, playing pedal steel guitar on ""Far, Far Away"" and ""Dreamer in My Dreams"", and then became an official member in September 1996.  Unlike the A.M. recording sessions, the band had no vocation for producing a hit song from their second effort. The recording sessions produced nineteen songs, too many for a single album release. Tweedy was concerned about the high retail price that a double album would be sold for (at least $30), so he asked reprise records to release it as a double album at a single album price ($17.98 or less). Reprise agreed to this on the terms that they received Wilco's share of the album royalties. It was estimated in 2003 that the band lost almost $600,000 on the deal, but Tweedy was satisfied. Being There was well-received by critics from several major media outlets, including Rolling Stone. The album reached #73 on the Billboard album charts, a significant improvement from A.M., and placed fourteenth on the Pazz & Jop Critics Poll for 1996.  Summerteeth and the Mermaid Avenue sessions  In November 1997, Wilco entered Willie Nelson's recording studio in Spicewood, Texas to record a third studio album. The album was lyrically inspired by the marital problems of Tweedy and his wife, as well as by twentieth-century literature. Tweedy relied heavily on Bennett to provide music for the singer's ""bold, but depressing"" lyrics. Wilco recorded several songs, including ""Via Chicago"" and ""She's A Jar,"" but began working on another project before assembling the tracks into an album.  Nora Guthrie contacted singer-songwriter Billy Bragg in spring 1995 about recording some unreleased songs by her father, folk singer Woody Guthrie. Most of the songs were written late in Guthrie's life when he was unable to record due to the motor impairments of Huntington's disease. By the 1990s, Woody Guthrie had become a ""relic"" to the MTV generation, and Nora sought to establish a different legacy for the musician. To Nora, Bragg was ""the only singer I knew taking on the same issues as Woody."" Bragg was concerned, however, that his fans would not realize that the songs were written by Guthrie when he performed them on tour, so he decided to record the album with another band.  Bragg contacted Tweedy and Bennett about co-recording the album while Wilco was on the European segment of their Being There tour. Bragg was particularly fond of Being There because their influences extended farther back than the 1950s. Although Tweedy was indifferent to the offer, Bennett was enthused about recording songs of one of his idols--Bennett's previous band Titanic Love Affair was named after a Billy Bragg lyric. A recording contract between Bragg and Wilco was signed after a show at Shepherd's Bush Empire. Bragg mostly recorded the politically-charged lyrics, while Tweedy preferred to record lyrics that showcased Guthrie as a ""freak weirdo."" The recording of Mermaid Avenue began on December 12, 1997, and was the topic of BBC's Man in the Sand documentary film.  Tempers flared between Bragg and Wilco after the album was completed. Bennett believed that Bragg was overproducing his songs, a sharp contrast to Wilco's sparser contributions. Bennett called Bragg about the possibility of remixing Bragg's songs, to which Bragg responded with ""you make your record, and I'll make mine, fucker."" Eventually Bragg sent copies of his recordings to Chicago for Bennett to remix, but Bragg refused to use the new mixes on the album. The two parties were unable to establish a promotional tour and quarreled over royalties and guest musician fees.  Despite these conflicts, the album was released on June 23, 1998, and sold over 277,000 copies. The album received rave reviews from Robert Christgau and Rolling Stone, and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album. It also placed fourth on the Pazz & Jop critics poll for 1998. After the album was released, Bob Egan was replaced by multi-instrumentalist Leroy Bach.  After the completion of the Mermaid Avenue sessions, Wilco returned to Spicewood to complete their third studio album, Summerteeth. Unlike previous Wilco and Uncle Tupelo recordings, the album featured a lot of overdubbing with Pro Tools. Stirratt and Coomer were concerned with the production, since it reduced their involvement in the music. According to Stirratt:""The story of Summerteeth is Jay bought a Mellotron and he was going to use it, no matter what. It was lovely, but it was overdone. Once they got going on the overdubs, they didn't stop. And nobody in the band stepped up to stop the madness ... It reminds me of Heart of Darkness, where you knowingly extend the creative process for the purpose of exploration or redemption, or whatever it is you're looking for."" During 1999, Warner Brothers was looking to help repay a $16 billion debt acquired during the recent merger of parent company Warner Communications with Time Inc... As a result, Warner's imprints were under pressure to produce musical acts that would yield hit records. The head of Reprise, Howie Klein, who had previously authorized the release of Being There as a double album, was willing to let Wilco produce Summerteeth without label input. When Klein played the album for Reprise's A&R department, however, they demanded a radio single for the album. Wilco agreed to do this ""once and once only"" and recorded a radio-friendly version of ""Can't Stand It"" at the request of David Kahne, the head of the A&R department. The single version of ""Can't Stand It"" failed to cross over from Triple-A radio to alternative rock stations. Consequently, the album sold only 200,000 copies, significantly less than Being There. This was despite critical acclaim; the album placed eighth on the Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 1999.  After the release of Summerteeth, the band resumed the Mermaid Avenue sessions. Although they had recorded enough material for a second release in 1998, Wilco recorded a few new songs for Mermaid Avenue Vol. II. ""Someday Some Morning Sometime,"" featuring a vibraphone filtered through a space echo, was identified by Tweedy as being the ""piece to the puzzle"" towards the creation of their fourth studio album. The album was released on May 30, 2000, and was the last release from the sessions.  Yankee Hotel Foxtrot  Shortly after the recording sessions for Mermaid Avenue Vol. II, Wilco purchased a studio in Irving Park, Chicago, which they named the Wilco Loft. The band recorded some tracks in the studio in early 2000 for a fourth studio album. In May 2000, Jeff Tweedy requested to perform with Jim O'Rourke at a festival in Chicago; Tweedy was a fan of O'Rourke's Bad Timing. O'Rourke introduced Tweedy to drummer Glenn Kotche, and the trio enjoyed working together so much that they decided to record an album as a side project named Loose Fur. Wilco had recorded an entire album of music at this point, but Tweedy was unhappy with the drum parts. He enjoyed Kotche's contributions to Loose Fur so much that Tweedy brought him into the studio to re-record some demos. Some believe that Tweedy sought to make Wilco sound like Loose Fur after officially replacing Ken Coomer with Kotche in January 2001.  Although Bennett sought to act as both mixer and engineer for Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, Tweedy was unsure of Bennett's abilities against those of O'Rourke. Tweedy and Bennett frequently argued over whether the album should be accessible to a general listener, or attempt to cover new musical ground. Unbeknownst to Bennett, Tweedy invited O'Rourke to remix ""I Am Trying to Break Your Heart"", and the results impressed the other band members--even Bennett. Tensions grew between Bennett and O'Rourke because Bennett wanted to mix every song on the album. O'Rourke cut the contributions of other members on several of the songs; some songs, such as ""Poor Places"", only featured the Loose Fur trio. The album was completed in 2001, and Bennett left the band immediately afterwards. The recording of the album was documented by Sam Jones and released in 2002 as the film I Am Trying to Break Your Heart.  Time Warner, which owned Warner Brothers, merged with America Online in 2001, leading to more pressure on Warner's record labels to cut costs. Over 600 employees of Warner Music Group were fired, including Howie Klein, the president of Reprise Records. In absence of Klein, David Kahne became the interim head of Reprise. Kahne assigned Mio Vukovic to monitor the progress of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and to offer suggestions. Music journalist Greg Kot claims that Vukovic disdained the album and was unhappy that Wilco ignored his suggestions. He brought the album to Kahne, who felt that there was no single on the album. In June 2001, the album was rejected by Reprise and Wilco was asked to leave the label.  Wilco managed to negotiate terms to a buy-out from Reprise. Music journalist Greg Kot claims that instead of financial compensation, the band agreed to leave the label with the master tapes of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. The label was already receiving bad publicity for its treatment of the band and were willing to accommodate Wilco's request. However, Allmusic claims that Wilco ""bought the finished studio tapes from Warner/Reprise for a reported $50,000 and left the label altogether"" after Wilco was ""unwilling to change the album to make it more 'commercially viable.'"" To curb the negative publicity, Reprise began to invest more in bands such as The Flaming Lips. Lead singer Wayne Coyne once remarked: ""We are benefiting from the label's regret over Wilco. We are living in the golden age of that being such a public mistake. The people on Warners said, 'we'll never have a band like Wilco feel we don't believe in them again.' They'd tell me that it would never happen to us. And what a great day for me!"" As the band searched for a new label to release the album, they decided to stream it at their official website to discourage illegal trading of low-quality MP3s. The band signed with Nonesuch Records, another Time Warner subsidiary, and the album was released in the spring of 2002. When it was released, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot reached number thirteen on the Billboard 200, Wilco's highest chart position to that date. Yankee Hotel Foxtrot sold over 590,000 copies, and to date remains Wilco's best selling album. Yankee Hotel Foxtrot was met with wide critical acclaim: it topped 2002's Pazz & Jop critics' poll, was named one of the 100 greatest albums of all time by Q Magazine, and was named one of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time by Rolling Stone.  Down with Wilco, A Ghost Is Born, and Kicking Television: Live in Chicago  While waiting for the commercial release of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, Wilco agreed to support R.E.M. collaborator Scott McCaughey for an album release by The Minus 5. They scheduled a recording session for September 11, 2001, but were distraught about the 9/11 terrorist attacks that day. Later that day, Wilco and McCaughey agreed to ""create something good in the world right now"" and record some material. Influenced by Bill Fay's Time Of The Last Persecution, The Minus 5's Down With Wilco was released in 2003.  In November 2003, Wilco traveled to New York City to record their fifth album. Unlike Summerteeth and Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, A Ghost is Born featured songs that were created with Pro Tools before ever performing them live. The album featured the song ""Less Than You Think"", which included a fifteen-minute track of electronic noises and synthesizers, which Tweedy called ""the track that everyone will hate"". Tweedy justified the inclusion of the song: ""I know ninety-nine percent of our fans won't like that song, they'll say its a ridiculous indulgence. Even I don't want to listen to it every time I play through the album. But the times I do calm myself down and pay attention to it, I think it's valuable and moving and cathartic. I wouldn't have put it on the record if I didn't think it was great ... I wanted to make an album about identity, and within that is the idea of a higher power, the idea of randomness, and that anything can happen, and that we can't control it."" Leroy Bach left the band immediately after the album's completion to join a music theatre operation in Chicago. Like Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, Wilco streamed the album online before its commercial release. Instead of using their own web page, the band streamed it in MPEG-4 form on Apple's website. Wilco sought to substantially change their lineup after Bach's departure, and added Mikael Jorgensen, who had engineered Down With Wilco, Pat Sansone of The Autumn Defense, and avant-garde guitarist Nels Cline to the lineup. Just as the band was about to tour to promote the album, Tweedy checked himself in to a rehabilitation clinic in Chicago for an addiction to painkillers. As a result, tour plans for Europe were canceled, and the release date for the album was set back several weeks. A Ghost is Born was released on June 22, 2004, and became Wilco's first top ten album in the U.S. The album earned Wilco Grammy Awards for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Recording Package in 2005. It also placed thirteenth on 2004's Pazz & Jop Critics Poll.  In 2004, the band released The Wilco Book, a picture book detailing the creation of A Ghost is Born. The book also contains writings and drawings from band members, as well as a CD with demos from the A Ghost is Born recording sessions. Also that year, Chicago Tribune music critic Greg Kot released a biography of the band entitled Wilco: Learning How to Die. The new six-piece Wilco lineup debuted on Kicking Television: Live in Chicago, a two disc live album recorded at The Vic Theater in Chicago. Released on November 15, 2005, the album received high accolades from Spin, Billboard, and Entertainment Weekly. As of 2007, it has sold over 114,000 copies.  Sky Blue Sky  Wilco returned to their loft in Chicago to record a sixth studio album in 2006. Influenced by The Byrds and Fairport Convention, the band considered Sky Blue Sky to be less experimental than previous releases. Also unlike previous albums, the songs were created as collaborations.  Wilco streamed the album online on March 3, 2007, and offered the song ""What Light"" as a free MP3 download. To further publicize the album, Wilco licensed several songs from the Sky Blue Sky recording sessions for use in a Volkswagen advertising campaign. The move was criticized by both critics and fans; Wilco responded by noting that they had previously done advertising campaigns with Apple Computers and Telefónica Móviles (Movistar). The album was released on May 15, 2007, and was a commercial success: it sold over 87,000 copies in its first week and peaked in the top five in the U.S. album charts. It also was a top forty hit in seven other countries.  Reviewer James Brubaker states that Wilco ""shines on a handful of the songs"" on Sky Blue Sky, such as the ""light, and straightforward"" songs. While he calls the album ""great traditional rock and folk album at times"", he states that ""once you get past the handful of masterful and lovely performances... the rest of the record comes off at times as dull, and forced"". The allaboutjazz review also had mixed comments. While praising the album as ""deceptively insinuating, almost intoxicating to listen to"" and noting its ""impeccable sound quality"", the reviewer claimed that ""Sky Blue Sky becomes the first Wilco album that sounds too careful for its own good.""  Pabs Hernandez, a reviewer for Lost at Sea praised the album's ""breezy atmosphere and pacing"", and noted that it is not ""easily judged upon first listen."" Overall, Hernandez stated that it ""may be no masterpiece, but at worst it's a more than worthy entry into Wilco's laudable catalogue."" Reviewer Greg Locke praised the record as ""one of the best albums of the year"", calling it a ""timeless record, full of sweet, hopeful sophistication and class"" and ""a lean, mean, soulful album."" Like Hernandez, Locke acknowledged that the album could not be properly judged just on the first listening. The NPR review also had a positive take on the record. While the NPR reviewer stated that the recording ""isn't groundbreaking"", they praised its ""coherent musical expression"" and emphasis on ""solid songcraft without pretense"" which created a ""satisfying and melodically sound albu[m].""  Musical style and influence  Wilco's music is typically categorized as alternative rock and alternative country. Despite their career long association with a major record label, they are generally associated with indie rock. Wilco draws influence from bands from a variety of musical genres, but primarily from music created between 1966 and 1974. John Cale's Paris 1919 was credited by the band as providing a musical parallel. According to Tweedy, ""It was eye-opening that I wasn't the only person that felt like these worlds had a lot more in common than they'd been given credit for--that experimentation and avant-garde theory was not directly opposed to beauty, y'know?""  Other recording artists from that timespan appreciated by the band include John Lennon, Neil Young, and Brian Wilson. For his thirty-fourth birthday, Tweedy received a private guitar lesson from Richard Lloyd of Television; Tweedy was a big fan of the group and was particularly fond of the guitar work, which he wanted to incorporate into his music. Uncle Tupelo was inspired by bands such as Jason & The Scorchers and The Minutemen, influencing the recording of Wilco's A.M.. Tweedy and O'Rourke enjoyed free jazz artists such as Ornette Coleman, Albert Ayler, and Derek Bailey; they also listen to mainstream jazz by artists such as Miles Davis and John Coltrane. The lyrical structure of Wilco's songs were dictated by classic literature and cadavre exquis--an exercise where band members take turns writing lines on a typewriter, but are only allowed to see the previously written line. Among the books that the band has cited as being stylistically influential include William H. Gass's In the Heart of the Heart of the Country, Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer, and Harold Bloom's The Anxiety of Influence: A Theory of Poetry.  Some critics have dubbed Wilco the ""American Radiohead"", due to their stylistically diverse catalog. A critic from the New York Times argues that Wilco has a ""roots-rock...[sound which] reached back to proven materials: the twang of country, the steady chug of 1960s rock, the undulating sheen of The Beach Boys, the honky-tonk hymns of The Band and the melodic symmetries of pop.""  Rolling Stone described Wilco as ""one of America's most consistently interesting bands"" and ""America's foremost rock impressionists."" Despite critical acclaim, Wilco's influence on modern rock has been limited. Bands that have been influenced by Wilco include Derek Webb (of Caedmon's Call), The National, and Grace Potter and the Nocturnals. English indie rock band Cherry Ghost took its name from a lyric from the Wilco song ""Theologians"" (from A Ghost is Born)--lead singer Simon Aldred is a self-proclaimed ""massive Wilco fan"". Pete Yorn's song ""Crystal Village"" was influenced by Wilco's ""She's A Jar."" On his 2004 album Live From New Jersey he introduces the song by saying, ""Someone accused me of ripping off Cat Stevens. And I was like, 'That's bullshit, man. I would never rip off Cat Stevens.' I ripped off Wilco on that song.""  http://www.wilcoworld.net, Since its very beginning, Wilco has continually sought to explore ..., www.wilcoworld.net, When pioneering alt-country band Uncle Tupelo split in the mid-1990s, ..., a band, Wilco rose from the ashes of the seminal roots rockers ..., Wilco rose from the ashes of the seminal roots rock ..., After seven studio albums, various collaborations and countless days on ..., Wilco is an American alternative rock band based in Chicago, Illinois. The band was formed in 1994 by the remaining members of alternative country group Uncle Tupelo following singer Jay Farrar's departure. Wilco's lineup changed frequently during its first decade, with only singer Jeff Tweedy and bassist John Stirratt remaining from the original incarnation. Since early 2004, the lineup has been unchanged, consisting of Tweedy, Stirratt, guitarist Nels Cline, multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansone, keyboard player Mikael Jorgensen, and drummer Glenn Kotche. Wilco has released eight studio albums, a live double album, and four collaborations: three with Billy Bragg and one with The Minus 5. 
Wilco's music has been inspired by a wide variety of artists and styles, including Bill Fay, The Beatles and Television, and has in turn influenced music by a number of modern alternative rock acts. The band continued in the alternative country of Uncle Tupelo on its debut album A.M. (1995), but has since introduced more experimental aspects to their music, including elements of alternative rock and classic pop. Wilco's musical style has evolved from a 1990s country rock sound to a current ""eclectic indie rock collective that touches on many eras and genres."" 
Wilco garnered media attention for its fourth album, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot (2002), and the controversy surrounding it. After the recording sessions were complete, Reprise Records rejected the album and dismissed Wilco from the label. As part of a buy-out deal, Reprise gave Wilco the rights to the album for free. After streaming Foxtrot on its website, Wilco sold the album to Nonesuch Records in 2002. Both record labels are subsidiaries of Warner Music Group, leading one critic to say the album showed ""how screwed up the music business is in the early twenty-first century.""Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is Wilco's most successful release to date, selling over 670,000 copies. Wilco won two Grammy Awards for their fifth studio album, 2004's A Ghost Is Born, including Best Alternative Music Album. Wilco's most recent studio album, The Whole Love, was released on September 27, 2011. 

History:

Formation:
Wilco was formed following the breakup of the influential alternative country music group Uncle Tupelo. Singer Jay Farrar quit the band in 1994 supposedly because of a soured relationship with co-singer Jeff Tweedy. Both Tweedy and Farrar sought to form bands immediately after the breakup. Tweedy was able to keep the entire Uncle Tupelo lineup sans Farrar, including bassist John Stirratt, drummer Ken Coomer, and multi-instrumentalist Max Johnston. He even enlisted Uncle Tupelo guest guitarist Brian Henneman of the Bottle Rockets, who performed on many of the tracks for Wilco's debut album, A.M.. The band was tempted to keep the Uncle Tupelo name, but ultimately decided to rename the band. The group named itself ""Wilco"" after the military and commercial aviation radio voice abbreviation for ""will comply"", a choice which Tweedy has called ""fairly ironic for a rock band to name themselves."" 

A.M. and Being There:
After collaborating with Syd Straw on a cover version of the Ernest Tubb song ""The T.B. is Whipping Me"" (released in September 1994 on the Red Hot + Country compilation produced by the Red Hot Organization), Wilco began recording tracks for A.M., their first studio album, at Easley studio in June 1994. A demo tape from these recordings was sent to executives at Reprise Records, a subsidiary of Warner Brothers, and the label signed Tweedy to a contract. Although Tweedy stated that he wanted a more collaborative project than Uncle Tupelo, only his name appeared on the Reprise contract. Tweedy requested songwriting submissions from other members, but only one submission--John Stirratt's ""It's Just That Simple""--appeared on A.M.. It was the last song Wilco ever released that was lyrically solely written by a member besides Tweedy. 
Stylistically similar to Uncle Tupelo, the music on A.M. was considered to be straightforward alternative country rock in what Tweedy later described as ""trying to tread some water with a perceived audience.""A.M. peaked at number twenty-seven on the Billboard Heatseekers chart, considerably lower than the debut album of Jay Farrar's new band, Son Volt. The album was met with modest reviews though it would rank thirty-fourth in the Village Voice's 1995 Pazz & Jop critics poll. Critically and commercially paling in comparison to the reception of Son Volt's album, the Wilco members perceived A.M. to be a failure. Shortly after the release of the album, multi-instrumentalist Jay Bennett joined the band, providing the band with a keyboardist and another guitarist. 
Wilco made its live debut on November 17, 1994 to a capacity crowd at Cicero's Basement Bar in St. Louis, Missouri (the band was billed for the occasion as ""Black Shampoo""). 
During the two hundred-date tour supporting A.M., Tweedy began to write songs for a second album. The lyrical theme of the songs reflected a relationship between musical artist and a listener; Tweedy chose this topic because he sought to eschew the alternative country fan base. Ken Coomer elaborated: 

The whole No Depression thing was funny to us because people seemed to forget that Jeff was a bigger punk-rock fan than a country fan. It led to things like us all switching instruments on ""Misunderstood,"" where I'm playing guitar. 

A number of songs were recorded with this theme, including ""Sunken Treasure"" and ""Hotel Arizona"", however, Wilco also recorded a number of songs in the style of A.M. Wilco named the album Being There after a Peter Sellers film of the same name. The band went through some personnel changes during the recording sessions. Max Johnston left the band because he felt that his role in the band had diminished in favor of Bennett; he had also been replaced by violinist Jesse Greene on one track because the band felt that Johnston was unable to play the part. Bob Egan of Freakwater briefly joined the band in the studio, playing pedal steel guitar on ""Far, Far Away"" and ""Dreamer in My Dreams"", and then became an official member in September 1996. 
Unlike the A.M. recording sessions, the band had no vocation for producing a hit song from their second effort. The recording sessions produced nineteen songs, too many for a single album release. Tweedy was concerned about the high retail price that a double album would be sold for (at least $30), so he asked Reprise Records to release it as a double album at a single album price ($17.98 or less). Reprise agreed to this on the terms that they received Wilco's share of the album royalties. It was estimated in 2003 that the band lost almost $600,000 on the deal, but Tweedy was satisfied.Being There was well received by critics from several major media outlets, including Rolling Stone. The album reached No. 73 on the Billboard album charts, a significant improvement from A.M., and placed fourteenth on the Pazz & Jop Critics Poll for 1996. 

Summerteeth and the Mermaid Avenue sessions:
In November 1997, Wilco entered Willie Nelson's recording studio in Spicewood, Texas to record a third studio album. The album was lyrically inspired by the marital problems of Tweedy and his wife, as well as by twentieth-century literature. Tweedy relied heavily on Bennett to provide music for the singer's ""bold, but depressing"" lyrics. Wilco recorded several songs, including ""Via Chicago"" and ""She's a Jar,"" but began working on another project before assembling the tracks into an album. 

Nora Guthrie contacted singer-songwriter Billy Bragg in spring 1995 about recording some unreleased songs by her father, folk singer Woody Guthrie. Most of the songs were written late in Guthrie's life when he was unable to record due to the motor impairments of Huntington's disease. By the 1990s, Woody Guthrie had become a ""relic"" to the MTV generation, and Nora sought to establish a different legacy for the musician. To Nora, Bragg was ""the only singer I knew taking on the same issues as Woody."" Bragg was concerned, however, that his fans would not realize that the songs were written by Guthrie when he performed them on tour, so he decided to record the album with another band. 
Bragg contacted Tweedy and Bennett about co-recording the album while Wilco was on the European segment of their Being There tour. Bragg was particularly fond of Being There because their influences extended farther back than the 1950s. Although Tweedy was indifferent to the offer, Bennett was enthused about recording songs of one of his idols--Bennett's previous band Titanic Love Affair was named after a Billy Bragg lyric. A recording contract between Bragg and Wilco was signed after a show at Shepherd's Bush Empire. Bragg mostly recorded the politically charged lyrics, while Tweedy preferred to record lyrics that showcased Guthrie as a ""freak weirdo"". The recording of Mermaid Avenue began on December 12, 1997, and was the topic of BBC's Man in the Sand documentary film. 
Tempers flared between Bragg and Wilco after the album was completed. Bennett believed that Bragg was overproducing his songs, a sharp contrast to Wilco's sparser contributions. Bennett called Bragg about the possibility of remixing Bragg's songs, to which Bragg responded ""you make your record, and I'll make mine, fucker."" Eventually Bragg sent copies of his recordings to Chicago for Bennett to remix, but Bragg refused to use the new mixes on the album. The two parties were unable to establish a promotional tour and quarreled over royalties and guest musician fees. 
Despite these conflicts, the album was released on June 23, 1998, and sold over 277,000 copies. The album received rave reviews from Robert Christgau and Rolling Stone, and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album. It also placed fourth on the Pazz & Jop critics poll for 1998. After the album was released, Bob Egan was replaced by multi-instrumentalist Leroy Bach. 
After the completion of the Mermaid Avenue sessions, Wilco returned to Spicewood to complete their third studio album, Summerteeth. Unlike previous Wilco and Uncle Tupelo recordings, the album featured a lot of overdubbing with Pro Tools. Stirratt and Coomer were concerned with the production, since it reduced their involvement in the music. According to Stirratt: 

The story of Summerteeth is Jay bought a Mellotron and he was going to use it, no matter what. It was lovely, but it was overdone. Once they got going on the overdubs, they didn't stop. And nobody in the band stepped up to stop the madness ... It reminds me of Heart of Darkness, where you knowingly extend the creative process for the purpose of exploration or redemption, or whatever it is you're looking for. 

During 1999, Warner Brothers was looking to help repay a $16 billion debt acquired during the recent merger of parent company Warner Communications with Time Inc.. As a result, Warner's imprints were under pressure to produce musical acts that would yield hit records. The head of Reprise, Howie Klein, who had previously authorized the release of Being There as a double album, was willing to let Wilco produce Summerteeth without label input. When Klein played the album for Reprise's A&R department, however, they demanded a radio single for the album. Wilco agreed to do this ""once and once only"" and recorded a radio-friendly version of ""Can't Stand It"" at the request of David Kahne, the head of the A&R department. The single version of ""Can't Stand It"" failed to cross over from Triple-A radio to alternative rock stations. Consequently, the album sold only 200,000 copies, significantly less than Being There. This was despite critical acclaim; the album placed eighth on the Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 1999. 
After the release of Summerteeth, the band resumed the Mermaid Avenue sessions. Although they had recorded enough material for a second release in 1998, Wilco recorded a few new songs for Mermaid Avenue Vol. II. ""Someday Some Morning Sometime,"" featuring a vibraphone filtered through a space echo, was identified by Tweedy as being the ""piece to the puzzle"" towards the creation of their fourth studio album. The album was released on May 30, 2000, and was the last release from the sessions. The remainder of the sessions were released in 2012 as Mermaid Avenue Vol. III, also part of Mermaid Avenue: The Complete Sessions. 

Yankee Hotel Foxtrot:

Shortly after the recording sessions for Mermaid Avenue Vol. II, Wilco purchased a studio on Irving Park Road in Chicago, which they named the Wilco Loft. The band recorded some tracks in the studio in early 2000 for a fourth studio album. In May 2000, Jeff Tweedy requested to perform with Jim O'Rourke at a festival in Chicago; Tweedy was a fan of O'Rourke's Bad Timing. O'Rourke introduced Tweedy to drummer Glenn Kotche, and the trio enjoyed working together so much that they decided to record an album as a side project named Loose Fur. Wilco had recorded an entire album of music at this point, but Tweedy was unhappy with the drum parts. He enjoyed Kotche's contributions to Loose Fur so much that Tweedy brought him into the studio to re-record some demos. Some believe that Tweedy sought to make Wilco sound like Loose Fur after officially replacing Ken Coomer with Kotche in January 2001. 
Although Bennett sought to act as both mixer and engineer for Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, Tweedy was unsure of Bennett's abilities against those of O'Rourke. Tweedy and Bennett frequently argued over whether the album should be accessible to a general listener, or attempt to cover new musical ground. Unbeknownst to Bennett, Tweedy invited O'Rourke to remix ""I Am Trying to Break Your Heart"", and the results impressed the other band members--even Bennett. Tensions grew between Bennett and O'Rourke because Bennett wanted to mix every song on the album. O'Rourke cut the contributions of other members on several of the songs; some songs, such as ""Poor Places"", only featured the Loose Fur trio. The album was completed in 2001, and Bennett was dismissed from the band immediately afterwards. The recording of the album was documented by Sam Jones and released in 2002 as the film I Am Trying to Break Your Heart: A Film About Wilco. 
Time Warner, which owned Warner Bros. Records, merged with America Online in 2001, leading to more pressure on Warner's record labels to cut costs. Over 600 employees of Warner Music Group were fired, including Howie Klein, the president of Reprise Records. In absence of Klein, David Kahne became the interim head of Reprise. Kahne assigned Mio Vukovic to monitor the progress of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and to offer suggestions. Music journalist Greg Kot claims that Vukovic disdained the album and was unhappy that Wilco ignored his suggestions. He brought the album to Kahne, who felt that there was no single on the album. In June 2001, the album was rejected by Reprise and Wilco was asked to leave the label. 
Wilco managed to negotiate terms to a buy-out from Reprise. Music journalist Greg Kot claims that instead of financial compensation, the band agreed to leave the label with the master tapes of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. The label was already receiving bad publicity for its treatment of the band and were willing to accommodate Wilco's request. However, Allmusic claims that Wilco ""bought the finished studio tapes from Warner/Reprise for a reported $50,000 and left the label altogether"" after Wilco was ""unwilling to change the album to make it more 'commercially viable'"" To curb the negative publicity, Reprise began to invest more in bands such as The Flaming Lips. Lead singer Wayne Coyne once remarked: 

We are benefiting from the label's regret over Wilco. We are living in the golden age of that being such a public mistake. The people on Warners said, ""we'll never have a band like Wilco feel we don't believe in them again."" They'd tell me that it would never happen to us. And what a great day for me! 

As the band searched for a new label to release the album, they decided to stream it at their official website to discourage illegal trading of low-quality MP3s. The band signed with Nonesuch Records, another Time Warner subsidiary, and the album was released in the spring of 2002. When it was released, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot reached number thirteen on the Billboard 200, Wilco's highest chart position to that date.Yankee Hotel Foxtrot sold over 590,000 copies, and to date remains Wilco's best selling album.Yankee Hotel Foxtrot was met with wide critical acclaim: it topped 2002's Pazz & Jop critics' poll, was named one of the 100 greatest albums of all time by Q Magazine. 
Rolling Stone rated it one of the top 500 albums of all time in May 2012. 

Down with Wilco, A Ghost Is Born, and Kicking Television: Live in Chicago:
While waiting for the commercial release of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, Wilco agreed to support R.E.M. collaborator Scott McCaughey for an album release by The Minus 5. They scheduled a recording session for September 11, 2001, but were distraught about the 9/11 terrorist attacks that day. Later that day, Wilco and McCaughey agreed to ""create something good in the world right now"" and record some material. Influenced by Bill Fay's Time of the Last Persecution, The Minus 5's Down with Wilco was released in 2003. Keyboardist Mikael Jorgensen, who had engineered Down with Wilco, joined Wilco in 2002 as they toured in support of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. 

In November 2003, Wilco traveled to New York City to record their fifth album. The album was produced by Jim O'Rourke, who mixed Foxtrot and was a member of Wilco side project Loose Fur. Unlike Summerteeth and Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, A Ghost Is Born featured songs that were created with Pro Tools before ever performing them live. The album featured the song ""Less Than You Think"", which included a fifteen-minute track of electronic noises and synthesizers, which Tweedy called ""the track that everyone will hate"". Tweedy justified the inclusion of the song: 

I know ninety-nine percent of our fans won't like that song, they'll say it's a ridiculous indulgence. Even I don't want to listen to it every time I play through the album. But the times I do calm myself down and pay attention to it, I think it's valuable and moving and cathartic. I wouldn't have put it on the record if I didn't think it was great ... I wanted to make an album about identity, and within that is the idea of a higher power, the idea of randomness, and that anything can happen, and that we can't control it. 

Leroy Bach left the band immediately after the album's completion to join a music theatre operation in Chicago. Like Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, Wilco streamed the album online before its commercial release. Instead of using their own web page, the band streamed it in MPEG-4 form on Apple's website. Wilco sought to substantially change their lineup after Bach's departure, and added Pat Sansone of The Autumn Defense, and avant-garde guitarist Nels Cline to the lineup. Just as the band was about to tour to promote the album, Tweedy checked himself into a rehabilitation clinic in Chicago for an addiction to opioids. As a result, tour plans for Europe were canceled, and the release date for the album was set back several weeks.A Ghost Is Born was released on June 22, 2004, and became Wilco's first top ten album in the U.S. The album earned Wilco Grammy Awards for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Recording Package in 2005. It also placed thirteenth on 2004's Pazz & Jop Critics Poll. 
In 2004, the band released The Wilco Book, a picture book detailing the creation of A Ghost Is Born. The book also contains writings and drawings from band members, as well as a CD with demos from the A Ghost Is Born recording sessions. Also that year, Chicago Tribune music critic Greg Kot released a biography of the band entitled Wilco: Learning How to Die.

Wilco returned to their loft in Chicago to record a sixth studio album in 2006. Influenced by The Byrds and Fairport Convention, the band considered Sky Blue Sky to be less experimental than previous releases. Also unlike previous albums, the songs were created as collaborations. 
Wilco streamed the album online on March 3, 2007, and offered the song ""What Light"" as a free MP3 download.

While the NPR reviewer stated that the recording ""isn't groundbreaking,"" they praised its ""coherent musical expression"" and emphasis on ""solid songcraft without pretense"" which created a ""satisfying and melodically sound album."" 
In anticipation of the 2008 US presidential election, Wilco released a downloadable version of Bob Dylan's ""I Shall Be Released"" that they performed with Fleet Foxes. The MP3 was available as a free download from the band's website in exchange for a promise to vote in the election. The band also made an appearance on The Colbert Report to support presidential candidate Barack Obama. Wilco released a live performance DVD, Ashes of American Flags, on April 18, 2009, to celebrate Record Store Day. 
In December 2008, Jeff Tweedy, Pat Sansone, Glenn Kotche and John Stirratt traveled to Auckland, New Zealand to participate in Neil Finn's 7 Worlds Collide sequel project, The Sun Came Out, joined by Ed O'Brien, Phil Selway, Johnny Marr, KT Tunstall, Liam Finn, and Lisa Germano. They wrote and recorded several new tracks for the Oxfam-benefiting album including ""You Never Know"", ""What Could Have Been"", ""Over and Done"" and ""Don't Forget Me"". Jeff Tweedy co-wrote ""Too Blue"" with Johnny Marr, and Glenn, John and Pat play on most tracks on the album. 
Having enjoyed their time in New Zealand and the vibe of Finn's own Roundhead Studios, the four members stayed in Auckland through January to record the foundation tracks for their next album. Jim Scott, who acted as engineer and mixer for the Neil Finn project, stayed on in the same capacity for the Wilco sessions. Nels Cline and Mikael Jorgensen would later add overdubs to these tracks at the band's Chicago Loft. 

Wilco (The Album):
Wilco released their seventh album, Wilco (The Album), on June 30, 2009. In March 2009, it was announced that singer-songwriter Feist would make a guest appearance on the new album, on the track ""You and I"". Like their previous three albums, Wilco streamed the entirety of the album on its website prior to release. The album hit the charts at a career-high No. 4 with sales of 99,000 on the Billboard Top 200 Album chart as well as the No. 2 spot on Billboard's Top Rock Albums chart. It marked Wilco's third top 10 album on the U.S. pop chart. The album's first single ""You Never Know"" reached the No. 1 spot on the AAA Chart, their first No. 1 in twelve years. 
Beginning in April 2009, the band freely distributed a cover of Woody Guthrie's ""The Jolly Banker"", downloadable from their website. It was recorded at the Wilco loft in February of that year, at the suggestion of Guthrie's daughter, Nora. Downloaders were encouraged to donate to the Woody Guthrie Foundation. Feist returned to accompany on the track, playing the Garden Weasel. The track eventually became unavailable for download. In October 2011, the website began streaming the track via a plugin. 
On May 25, 2009, former band member Jay Bennett died in his home in Urbana, Illinois. In a prepared statement, Jeff Tweedy remarked that he was ""deeply saddened"" by Bennett's death. 
Feist and Wilco performed ""You and I"" on Late Show with David Letterman on July 14, 2009. In June during their West Coast tour, Wilco joined Beck, Feist, Jamie Lidell and James Gadson in the studio to take part in Beck's Record Club project, covering Skip Spence's Oar album. The first song ""Little Hands"" was posted on Beck's website on November 12, 2009. 
On April 6, 2010, Wilco announced during their Boston performance that they would be headlining and curating a festival in North Adams, Massachusetts, dubbed Solid Sound Festival. The event ran at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art from August 13-15, and featured various Wilco side projects, including The Autumn Defense, Pronto, The Nels Cline Singers, and Jeff Tweedy solo. Other bands who appeared included Mavis Staples, Avi Buffalo, Outrageous Cherry, Richard Bishop, The Books, and Vetiver. It also featured non-musical media, such as the Bread and Puppet Theater and comedians Todd Barry, Kristen Schaal, John Mulaney, and Hannibal Buress as well as interactive musical installations by Cline and Kotche. 
Wilco's contract with Nonesuch ended in 2010 and they formed their own label. Wilco announced via their web site and Twitter page on January 27, 2011 that the new label will be called dBpm Records (Decibels per Minute) and will be run out of the offices of their manager, Tony Margherita, in Easthampton, Massachusetts. 

The Whole Love:
Wilco's eighth studio album, The Whole Love, was released on September 27, 2011. The first single of the album is titled ""Art of Almost"". The B-Side to ""I Might"" is a cover of Nick Lowe's 1977 song ""I Love My Label"". The single was shown at the Wilco's 2011 Solid Sound Festival at MassMoca and was met by positive reviews. The entire album was streamed live on Wilco's official website for 24 hours between September 3 and 4, 2011. 

Musical style and influence:

Wilco's music is typically categorized as alternative rock and alternative country. Despite their career-long association with a major record label, they are generally associated with indie rock. Wilco draws influence from bands from a variety of musical genres, but primarily from music created between 1966 and 1974.John Cale's Paris 1919 was credited by the band as providing a musical parallel. According to Tweedy, ""It was eye-opening that I wasn't the only person that felt like these worlds had a lot more in common than they'd been given credit for--that experimentation and avant-garde theory was not directly opposed to beauty, y'know?"" 
Other recording artists from that timespan appreciated by the band include John Lennon, Neil Young, and Brian Wilson. For his thirty-fourth birthday, Tweedy received a private guitar lesson from Richard Lloyd of Television; Tweedy was a fan of the group and was particularly fond of the guitar work, which he wanted to incorporate into his music. Uncle Tupelo was inspired by bands such as Jason & the Scorchers and The Minutemen, influencing the recording of Wilco's A.M.. Tweedy and O'Rourke enjoyed free jazz artists such as Ornette Coleman, Albert Ayler, and Derek Bailey; they also listen to mainstream jazz by artists such as Miles Davis and John Coltrane. The lyrical structure of Wilco's songs was dictated by classic literature and cadavre exquis--an exercise where band members take turns writing lines on a typewriter, but are only allowed to see the previously written line. Among the books that the band has cited as being stylistically influential include William H. Gass's In the Heart of the Heart of the Country, Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer, and Harold Bloom's The Anxiety of Influence: A Theory of Poetry. 
Some critics have dubbed Wilco the ""American Radiohead"", due to their stylistically diverse catalog. A critic from the New York Times argues that Wilco has a ""roots-rock ... sound which reached back to proven materials: the twang of country, the steady chug of 1960s rock, the undulating sheen of the Beach Boys, the honky-tonk hymns of the Band and the melodic symmetries of pop."" 
Rolling Stone described Wilco as ""one of America's most consistently interesting bands"" and ""America's foremost rock impressionists."" Bands that have been influenced by Wilco include Derek Webb (of Caedmon's Call),The National, and Grace Potter and the Nocturnals. English indie rock band Cherry Ghost took its name from a lyric from the Wilco song ""Theologians"" (from A Ghost Is Born)--lead singer Simon Aldred is a self-proclaimed ""massive Wilco fan"". Other notable artists who have covered Wilco live include Norah Jones performing ""Jesus, Etc."" which took place at the 2008 Bridge School Benefit where they both performed, a version of which was released as a bonus track on her 2009 release The Fall, Widespread Panic, and Counting Crows and the Wallflowers performing ""California Stars.""

In 2009, Bundick earned a BFA in Graphic Design from The University of South Carolina.    Chaz Bundick's methods are constantly evolving. While heavily influenced by his parent's vinyl and tape collection, his contemporary influences are Animal Collective, Sonic Youth, J Dilla, and Daft Punk.    Toro y Moi started in 2007 as a bedroom project that quickly grew into live performance. The music is associated with the chillwave movement but the sound is influenced by freak folk, R&B, and french house.  Toro y Moi is signed to Carpark Records. The first full-length album, Causers of This, was released in January 2010.  Toro y Moi's second album Underneath the Pine was released in February 2011.  His EP titled Freaking Out was released in September of 2011.  A compilation of songs titled June 2009 was released in April of 2012.

His music has taken on many forms since he began recording, but he is often identified with the rise of the chillwave movement in 2010 and 2011. His stage name is a multilingual expression consisting of the Spanish words toro and y (meaning ""bull"" and ""and"", respectively), and the French word moi (which means ""me""). 

Early life:
Chazwick Bradley Bundick was born on November 7, 1986 in Columbia, South Carolina, to a Filipino mother and an African-American father. He attended Ridge View High School, where he formed the indie rock band The Heist and The Accomplice with three schoolmates. 
Bundick graduated from the University of South Carolina in spring of 2009 with a bachelor's degree in graphic design. Late in his school career, Toro y Moi formed a close musical relationship with fellow chillwave artist Ernest Greene, who performs under the name Washed Out. 

Career:

Causers of This (2010):
In mid-2009, Toro y Moi was signed to Carpark Records, on which he released his debut full-length album Causers of This in January 2010. On Causers of This, Bundick experimented with sampling and production techniques using the digital audio workstation Reason. The album garnered comparisons to the ""chillwave"" subgenre; however, Bundick stated that he never classified his music as such. Bundick refers to the album's subject matter as ""personal,"" calling it a ""break-up album."" Tours supporting Ruby Suns, Caribou, and Phoenix followed the album's release. 

Underneath the Pine and Freaking Out EP (2011):
Toro y Moi's second album, Underneath the Pine, was released on February 22, 2011. The album was recorded at Bundick's home in-between tours while supporting Causers of This. Underneath the Pine marked a stylistic departure from the previous album in that it was made up of all live instrumentation and contained no samples. Bundick cites horror movie soundtracks, space disco, and film composers Piero Umiliani and François de Roubaix as inspiration for the album's sound. Further, Budick states ""...what influenced Underneath the Pine was finding stuff that I wanted to sample for Causers. A lot of the things I sampled for Causers ended up being the main musical inspiration for Underneath the Pine."" 
In an interview with website At the Sinema, he suggested that he had moved beyond the chillwave genre: ""All that stuff is really good music, like Ernest Green (Washed Out) and Neon Indian. I'm a big fan of all of that, but I think chillwave was just a small little period where we all were, coincidentally."" 
On September 13, 2011 Toro y Moi released an EP titled Freaking Out, featuring a cover of ""Saturday Love"" by Cherrelle and Alexander O'Neal. The EP's sound was heavily influenced by 80's Boogie and R&B. 
The band was chosen by Caribou to perform at the ATP Nightmare Before Christmas festival that they co-curated in December 2011 in Minehead, England. 

Anything in Return (2013):
In January 2013, Toro y Moi released his third studio album, Anything in Return, which he described as having a 90's dance and R&B sound. According to him, the album was ""influenced by lots of different types of house, from deep house to two-step ... The chords 'Harm in Change' and 'Say That' use--that's just something I've been a fan of for a while. I really wanted to mess around with those kinds of elements and revisit what I did on Causers of This, but make those elements a little bit better and more apparent."" The album was called ""highly indebted to the late sacrosanct hip-hop producer J Dilla"" by the San Francisco Bay Guardian. Bundick stated that he wanted to combine electronic production of his first record with the elements of traditional instrumentation of his second album. The album lyrically focuses on Bundick's move across country to California with his girlfriend and the strain touring puts on a relationship. In promotion of Anything in Return, Toro y Moi embarked on an international tour and made an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. 

What For? (2015):
In January 2015, Toro y Moi announced a new album What For? to be released April 7th by Carpark Records and shared a new track ""Empty Nesters."" 
In his home studio, Bundick utilizes a Roland JX-3P, Moog Voyager, Fender Rhodes, and various soft synths. 
On April 30, 2015, Toro y Moi released the music video for ""Lilly"".  

Side projects:
Bundick makes electronic dance music and DJs under the moniker Les Sins. As Les Sins, Bundick has put out a series of 12"" records on Carpark Records and Jiaolong Records. Bundick stated that Les Sins ""was just another way to make weirder music without having to feel I'm alienating Toro y Moi fans. So it's kind of nice to do whatever kind of song I want to do without having to worry about it being accessible."" Les Sins' debut full length album, Michael, was released on November 4, 2014 on Bundick's own Company Records. 
Bundick put out a collection of experimental ""stream of consciousness"" recordings under the moniker Sides of Chaz. Releases have included a tour CD-R and a single, ""Sweet Tea,"" put out on Fork and Spoon Records. 
On December 10, 2014, Bundick and Vinyl Williams released a collaborative interactive album available for download on Bittorrent which combined both audio and visuals. The album, Trance Zen Dental Spa, was brought about after Bundick and Vinyl Williams met in Seoul, South Korea.

History:
Evan Mast and Mike Stroud first met as students at Skidmore College, but they did not work together until 2001, when they recorded several songs under the name ""Cherry"". Their 2004 debut, Ratatat, was written and recorded in Mast's Crown Heights, Brooklyn apartment on his laptop. The album is entirely instrumental with the exception of vocal excerpts at the beginning and end of select tracks. 
The group debuted by releasing the single ""Seventeen Years"" on Mast's and his brother Eric's (E*Rock) record label Audio Dregs in the US and Rex Records in the UK. They then signed for XL Recordings, releasing their debut album and the single ""Germany to Germany"". Ratatat occasionally remixed tracks by other artists for collected release on Ratatat Remixes Vol. 1 (which garnered the attention of Rolling Stone), as well as the later second volume, both of which were self-released in co-operation with Audio Dregs. 
Both musicians have had experience with other projects, such as Mast's E*vax and King Pang and Stroud's stage work with Dashboard Confessional. Stroud has also recorded with Ben Kweller on On My Way. Ratatat has toured with bands such as Björk, Daft Punk, Mouse on Mars, Interpol, Franz Ferdinand, CSS, The Faint, Super Furry Animals, Clinic, Panther, and The Killers. In 2010, they supported Vampire Weekend on their UK Tour. 
On October 6, 2006, Ratatat became the first band to perform a public show inside the Guggenheim Museum in New York City. 
On October 10, 2006, a new demo album from Ratatat titled 9 Beats was leaked online. This set of tracks does not appear on any official discography listings. 9 Beats was not an official album, the tracks consist of short instrumental electronic musical pieces and demos for their next mixtape. This release was followed by another remix album, Ratatat Remixes Vol 2. 
It was rumored that they would be signed by Star Trak Entertainment as the understudies of The Neptunes. 
Mast has most recently collaborated with former Shudder to Think vocalist Craig Wedren on a record for a Tokyo independent label, Mold Recordings and said to be finishing a follow up solo album for Audio Dregs. 
From June 2007 until October 2008, Ratatat had Martin Bonventre accompany them on their European tour and Fall shows in America as the pianist/synthesizer player. Bonventre drew much attention due to his erratic dance movements on stage. The reason for him leaving the performance is unknown. 
Ratatat's live performances bear strong similarities to the performances of the psychedelic rock bands out of San Francisco in the 1960s, with energetic light shows, swirling colors projected onto a screen, and random clips of movies thrown in. Evan Mast creates and edits the videos that are projected on the screen. Many of them are included on their YouTube account. The front page of their official website has a list of tour locations and dates. Cameras are usually not allowed when attending one of their concerts. 
The official site has been updated showing the videos of the three first singles of their third album LP3, which was released on July 8, 2008. ""Shiller"", ""Shempi"" and then ""Mirando"" have all been released (or announced) on 7"" or 12"" singles, ""Shiller"" being first released with a special b-side, the track ""Mahalo"". 
Ratatat contributed two songs to Man on the Moon: The End of Day, the debut album by alternative rapper Kid Cudi, released September 15, 2009. They performed together on Late Show with David Letterman on September 11, 2009. The two songs are produced in the similar electronic style Ratatat is known for; those titled ""Alive"" and ""Pursuit Of Happiness"" featuring MGMT. 
According to Mike Stroud in an interview conducted by Julia Askenase of Paste Magazine released on August 4, 2009, ""most of LP4 was recorded during the same studio sessions that yielded LP3"". Ratatat's fourth album, LP4, was released on June 8, 2010, via XL Recordings. 
Ratatat have supported Vampire Weekend at The Brighton Centre and Alexandra Palace. In 2010 their song Neckbrace was used in the ski film ""The Way I See It"" by Matchstick Productions. Their track ""Mirando"" was used in Prada's SS2011 ad campaign. 
In August 2011, Ratatat was featured in the song ""Red Alert"" on CSS's new album La Liberación. 
On September 29, 2012 past collaborator Kid Cudi confirmed that Ratatat would be featured and producing on his upcoming third studio album Indicud, however the collaboration didn't make the final cut after Kid Cudi decided to produce the whole album by himself, with the exception of an additional production by Hit-Boy on the track ""Red Eye"" featuring Haim. 
In May 2013 they entered the Austrian Singlecharts after the Austrian network provider A1 used ""Loud Pipes"" for a radio-advertisement. 
The band played Coachella Festival and Governor's Ball Music Festival in 2015. They debuted their new song, ""Cream On Chrome,"" just a few hours before their night-ending Coachella set on April 11, 2015. The band also played a concert in Pomona, California on April 15, 2015.  
In May 2015, the band announced that their fifth album, Magnifique, would be released on July 17, 2015, and will feature a cover of the 1971 Springwater single ""I Will Return"".]",0.461174447835,0.712709,"[indietronica, alternative dance, dance-punk, new rave, synthpop]",0.792445,0.118280781703,0.72057944421,0.290193791981,0.706985088767,0.813230105908,7.0,0.190901783551,0.814916828689,0.0,0.0390695367531,0.559353501443,4.0,0.845760720415,1

Known as ""America's Band"", they are easily recognized by their complex vocal harmonies. Initially recording music that focused on Californian youth culture, halfway through the decade they shifted their attention towards melancholy orchestral pop, and continued to experiment with other genres. With the release of 1974's Endless Summer they became a more popular touring act, playing their greatest hits. They have recorded 36 Billboard Top 40 hits (including four number-one singles), have had over 100 million sales, and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988.  Formed in Hawthorne, California in 1961, the original group comprised singer-musician-composer Brian Wilson, his brothers Carl Wilson and Dennis Wilson, their cousin Mike Love, and friends Al Jardine and David Marks.  South African musicians Blondie Chaplin and Ricky Fataar played and sang with the band on three key albums during the early 1970s. Many changes in both musical style and personnel have occurred in their sometimes-stormy career: Brian Wilson's mental illness, drug addiction and eventual withdrawal from the group; the deaths of Dennis Wilson in 1983 and Carl Wilson in 1998; and continuing legal battles among surviving members of the group.  In December 2011, five of the group's surviving members - Brian, Mike, Al, Bruce and David (But not Blondie or Ricky) - reformed in celebration of their 50th anniversary, announcing that a new album and a 50-date international tour had been planned for 2012. The tour begun in on April 24, 2012 with a headlining performance at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival. Songfacts reports that the first single from the  album, That's Why God Made the Radio, made it's national radio debut on April 25, 2012 on ESPN's Mike and Mike in the Morning.  Early Years  The group was formed in 1961 in Hawthorne, California under the leadership of Brian Wilson, and included his brothers Carl and Dennis, their cousin Mike Love and school friend Al Jardine.  The early inspirations of the group were the Wilsons' musician father, Murry, and the close vocal harmonies of groups such as The Four Freshmen. The group performed initially as The Pendletones, after the Pendleton woolen shirts popular then. Although surfing motifs were very prominent in their early songs, Dennis was the sole actual surfer in the group. He suggested to his brothers that they do some songs celebrating his hobby and the lifestyle which had developed around it in Southern California.  At first Murry Wilson, by many accounts a hard-driving man, steered The Beach Boys' career, engineering their signing with Capitol Records in 1962. In 1964 Brian Wilson fired his father after a violent confrontation in the studio. Over the next few years they became increasingly estranged; when Murry died some years later, Brian and Dennis did not attend the funeral.  The Beach Boys' early material focused on the California youth lifestyle (e.g., ""All Summer Long"", ""Fun, Fun, Fun""), cars (""Little Deuce Coupe"") and of course surfing (""Surfin' U.S.A."", ""Surfin' Safari"" and many others). Although their music was bright and accessible, these early works contained remarkably sophisticated musical ideas. During this period, Brian Wilson rapidly progressed to become a melodist, arranger, and producer of world-renowned stature. Their early hits made them major pop stars in America and other countries, although their status as America's top pop group was challenged in 1964 by the emergence of The Beatles, who became The Beach Boys' major creative rival.  Like The Beatles, the Beach Boys showed very fast development during the mid-'60s, drawing upon the innovations of songwriters and producers such as Burt Bacharach and especially Phil Spector. They produced the enduring classic ""California Girls"" in 1965, a banner year for popular music which also saw similarly advanced singles by The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Byrds, and James Brown. But it was the Beach Boys' role to create a myth of American freedom and dreams of adolescence, and increasingly, to articulate a dread of what lay after adolescence.  Brian's innovations and personal difficulties  During 1964, Brian Wilson began to suffer from anxiety attacks, and withdrew from touring to concentrate on song writing and record production. Glen Campbell served as Wilson's replacement on tours, until his own career success required him to leave the group. Bruce Johnston was asked to locate a replacement for Campbell; having failed to find one, Johnston subsequently became a full-time member of the band, first replacing Wilson on the road, and then contributing his talents in the studio.  Wilson's growing mastery of the recording studio and his increasingly sophisticated songs and complex arrangements reached an early peak with the acclaimed LP Pet Sounds (1966). Classic singles from that album, ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"" and ""God Only Knows"" showed Wilson's growing skill as a composer, arranger and producer. ""God Only Knows"" is said to have been the first pop single ever released in the U.S. to have the word ""God"" in the title (because of which many radio stations in the U.S. refused to play it.) ""Caroline, No"" also taken from Pet Sounds, was issued as a Brian Wilson solo single, the only time Brian was credited as a solo artist during the early Capitol years.  The album's meticulously layered harmonies and inventive instrumentation (performed by the cream of Los Angeles session musicians known as The WRECKING CREW) set a new standard for popular music. It remains one of the more evocative releases of the decade, with a distinctive strain of melancholy and nostalgia for youth. The album is still widely regarded as a classic and Paul McCartney has named it one of his favorite albums of all time, (with ""God Only Knows"" as his favorite song) often saying that it was a major influence on The Beatles' album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Despite the critical praise it received, the album was poorly promoted by Capitol Records and failed to become the major hit Brian had hoped it would be (only reaching #10). Its failure to gain wide recognition hurt him deeply.  Because of his withdrawal from touring, Wilson was able to complete almost all the backing for the album while the Beach Boys were on tour in Japan. They returned to find a substantially complete album, requiring only their vocals to finish it off. There was some resistance from within the band to this new direction. Lead singer Mike Love is reported to have been strongly opposed to it, partly because he feared the band would lose its audience if they changed their successful formula, and partly because he personally disliked the new material, which he famously criticized as ""Brian's ego music."" At Love's insistence, Brian changed the title of one song from ""Hang on to Your Ego"" to ""I Know There's an Answer"". Another likely factor in Love's antipathy to Pet Sounds was that Wilson worked extensively on it with outside lyricist Tony Asher rather than with Love, even though Love had co-written the lyrics for many of their earlier songs and was the lead vocalist on most of their early hits. It should also be stated that Love, as recently as February 2008 in a top British music magazine, denies emphatically that he was opposed to Brian's new directions. Quite the contrary, contributing the lyrics to the classic form of ""Good Vibrations,"" which certainly seemed to usher in flower power. He really is tired of this view of him as being Brian's nemesis. He could see Brian was destroying himself and that was what he feared.  Seeking to expand on the advances made on Pet Sounds, Wilson began an even more ambitious project, originally dubbed Dumb Angel. Its first fruit was ""Good Vibrations,"" which Brian described as ""a pocket symphony"". The song became the Beach Boys' biggest hit to date, and a US and UK # 1 single in 1966 -- many critics consider it to be one of the best rock singles of all time. In 1997 it was named the ""Greatest Single of All Time"" by Mojo music magazine, in 2000, VH1 placed it at number 8 on their ""100 Greatest Rock Songs"" list, and in late 2004 Rolling Stone magazine placed it at number 6 on their ""500 Best Songs of All Time"" list. It was also one of the more complex pop productions ever undertaken, and was reputed to have been the most expensive American single ever recorded, costing a reported $16,000 -- more than most pop albums of that time -- with sessions stretching over several months in at least three major studios.  In contrast to his work on Pet Sounds, Wilson adopted a modular approach to ""Good Vibrations"" -- he broke the song into sections and taped multiple versions of each at different studios to take advantage of the different sound of each facility. He then assembled his favorite sections into a master backing track and added vocals. The song's innovative instrumentation included drums, organ, piano, tack piano, two basses, guitars, electro-theremin, harmonica, and cello. The group members recall the ""Good Vibrations"" vocal sessions as among the most demanding of their career.  Even as his personal life deteriorated, Wilson's musical output remained remarkable. The exact nature of his problems was a topic of much speculation. He abused drugs heavily, gained an enormous amount of weight, suffered long bouts of depression, and became paranoid. Several biographies have suggested that his father may have had bipolar disorder, and after years of suffering, Wilson's own condition was eventually diagnosed as schizophrenia.  The story behind ""Smile""  Shortly after completing ""Good Vibrations,"" Wilson met session musician and songwriter Van Dyke Parks, and in late 1966 they began an intense collaboration that resulted in a suite of superb new songs for the Beach Boys' next album, which was originally going to be titled Dumb Angel but was renamed Smile. Using the same methods as on ""Good Vibrations,"" recording began in late 1966 and carried on into early 1967. Although the structure of the album and the exact running order of the songs have been subjects of endless speculation, it is apparent that Wilson and Parks intended Smile to be a continuous suite of songs that were linked both thematically and musically, with the main songs being linked together by small vocal pieces and instrumental segments that elaborated the musical themes of the major songs.  But some of the other Beach Boys -- especially Love -- found the new music too difficult and too far removed from their established style; another serious concern was that the new music was simply not feasible for live performance by the current Beach Boys lineup. Love was bitterly opposed to Smile and was particularly critical of Parks' lyrics; he has also since stated that he was becoming deeply concerned about Wilson's escalating drug intake. The problems came to a head during the recording of ""Cabinessence,"" when Love demanded that Parks explain the meaning of the closing refrain of the song, ""Over and over the crow cries uncover the cornfield."" After a heated argument, Parks walked out and his partnership with Wilson came to an abrupt end.  Many factors combined to focus intense pressure on Wilson as Smile neared completion, including mental instability, the pressure to perform against fierce opposition to his new music, the relatively poor response to Pet Sounds, Carl Wilson's draft resistance, and a major dispute with Capitol. Matters were complicated by his reliance on both prescription and illegal drugs, particularly marijuana and amphetamines, which only exacerbated his underlying mental health problems.  Just weeks before The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band was released, Smile was shelved. Over the next 30 years the legends surrounding Smile grew, until it became the most famous unreleased album in the history of popular music. Some of the tracks were salvaged and rerecorded at Brian's new home studio in drastically scaled-down versions. These were released, along with the completed versions of ""Good Vibrations"" and ""Heroes and Villains"", on the 1967 LP Smiley Smile, which would prove to be a critical and commercial disaster for the group.  Despite the cancellation of Smile, interest in the work remained high and versions of several major tracks -- including ""Our Prayer"", ""Cabinessence"", ""Cool, Cool Water"", and ""Surf's Up"" -- were assembled by Carl Wilson over the next few years and included on later albums. The band was expecting to complete and release Smile even until 1972, when it became clear that only Brian would ever be able to make sense out of the endless fragments that were recorded. A substantial number of original tracks and linking fragments were included on the group's 30th anniversary CD boxed set in 1993. Smile itself, in its original conception, did not surface until Wilson and Parks completed the writing and Brian rerecorded it as a solo project in 2004.  Mid-career brings changes  Following their peak popularity with the song ""Good Vibrations"" was a period of declining commercial success, with Smiley Smile and subsequent albums doing poorly on the US charts (although they fared better in the UK). Their image problems were not helped by the criticism that followed their withdrawal from the bill of the 1967 Monterey International Pop Festival as a result of Carl's draft problems, an event that would undoubtedly have been crucial in establishing their new sound had they been able to present their new material there.  The 1967 album Wild Honey, regarded by many critics as a classic, features exuberant upbeat songs written by Brian and Mike, including the hit ""Darlin'"", and a cover of Stevie Wonder's ""I Was Made to Love Her"". Friends (1968) is a quiet, tuneful, and largely acoustic album, influenced by the group's adoption of the practice of transcendental meditation. The title single, however, backed by Dennis' songwriting debut Little Bird, was their least successful since 1962. This was followed by the single ""Do It Again"", a return to their earlier ""fun in the sun"" style, which was moderately successful in the US, but went to #1 in the UK.  As Brian's health deteriorated in the late 1960s and early 1970s, his song output diminished and he became increasingly withdrawn from the group. To fill the void, the other members of the group began writing songs, and Carl gradually took over leadership of the band, developing into an accomplished producer. To complete their contract with Capitol Records before signing with Reprise, they produced one more album, 20/20 (1969), primarily a collection of leftovers (including some from Smile), cover songs, and several new songs by Dennis. One of Denny's songs, ""Never Learn Not to Love"", featured lyrics by Charles Manson originally titled ""Cease to Exist"". Besides ""Do It Again"", the album included their cover of The Ronettes' ""I Can Hear Music"", their last top 40 hit for seven years.  Their first two Reprise LPs were Sunflower (1970) and 1971's Surf's Up, featuring new songs by Brian and all the group members, plus selections from the aborted Smile project. According to the liner notes for the 2004 version of Smile, Reprise expected the legendary album to be completed and released as part of the new contract, but this was never to be; however, these albums included some of their most evolved and complex music since the Smile period.  The addition of Ricky Fataar and Blondie Chaplin in 1972 led to a dramatic departure in sound for the band. Carl and the Passions - So Tough was an uncharacteristic mix including several songs unrecognizable as the Beach Boys. Although it includes the classic ""Marcella"", many consider the album among their poorest efforts. Continuing with Fataar and Chaplin, Holland (1973) was more successful. The album's lead single ""Sail On Sailor,"" a brief return to the collaboration between Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks, was one of the more emblematic of Beach Boys songs. Although it did not produce any top-40 hits, Holland was popular on free-form FM-radio, and includes several classics including Al Jardine's ""California Saga/California"".  In the summer of 1974 Capitol, in consultation with Love, released a double album compilation of the Beach Boys' pre-Pet Sounds hits, entitled Endless Summer. Helped by a sunny, colorful graphic cover, it caught the mood of the country and surged to #1 on the Billboard album chart, becoming their first gold record since ""Good Vibrations"", and stayed on the album chart for three years. The following year another compilation, Spirit of America, also did well. These sales performances demonstrated that the classic Beach Boys sound was back in fashion.  In 1975, the Beach Boys staged a highly successful joint concert tour with Chicago, with each group performing some of the other's songs, including their previous year's collaboration on Chicago's hit ""Wishing You Were Here"". Beach Boy voices were also heard on Elton John's 1974 hit ""Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me"", but following Holland, the group produced no new music until 1976.  Brian's return  15 Big Ones marked the return of Brian Wilson as a major force in the group. This album includes several new songs composed by Brian, and several of his arrangements of favorite old songs by other artists, including ""Rock and Roll Music"" (which made #5), ""Blueberry Hill"", and ""In The Still of The Night"". Brian and Mike's ""It's OK"" was a return to their earlier ""fun-in-the-sun"" style, and was a moderate hit.  In 1977 the Beach Boys released the LP Love You, a collection of 14 songs mostly written by Brian alone, including more ""fun"" songs (""Honkin' Down the Highway""), a mature love song (""Let's Put Our Hearts Together"") - a quirky mix ranging from infectious to touching to downright silly. Although not a commercial success, the album has since gained the status of a classic within the Beach Boys' oeuvre.  Brian's contributions diminished over the next several albums until he again virtually withdrew from the group. Although he appeared sporadically with them in concert, he contributed little to their performances or recordings. Despite a much-publicised ""Brian's Back"" campaign in the late '70s, most critics believed the group was past their prime. Many expected that Brian would one day become the latest in a long line of celebrity drug casualties.  Deaths of Dennis and Carl Wilson  In the late 70s Dennis Wilson also began to suffer increasingly from drug and alcohol abuse, and some of the group's concert appearances were marred when he and other band members showed up onstage drunk or drugged. The band was forced to publicly apologize after a shambolic performance in Sydney in 1979 during which several members of the group appeared to be drunk. In spite of his own frequent drinking, Dennis Wilson managed to release his first solo work, Pacific Ocean Blue, and to launch the now famed work-in-progress Bambu, with friend and musician Carli Muñoz.  In 1980, the Beach Boys played a Fourth of July concert on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. before a vast crowd. This tradition continued for the next two years, but in 1983 Secretary of the Interior James Watt banned the group from playing on the Mall, saying that rock concerts drew ""an undesirable element"". This drew howls of outrage from the many of the Beach Boys' American fans, who stated that the Beach Boys sound was a very desirable part of the American cultural fabric. First Lady Nancy Reagan apologized, and in 1985 the group appeared on the Mall again. The group most recently appeared on the Mall in 2005 for the Fourth of July concert.  Dennis Wilson's problems had escalated in the early 1980s, and he accidentally drowned in late 1983 while diving from his boat as he drunkenly tried to recover items he had previously thrown overboard. Despite Dennis's death, The Beach Boys soldiered on, and they enjoyed a resurgence of interest later in the 1980s, assisted by tributes such as the David Lee Roth version of ""California Girls"". In 1987, they played with the rap group The Fat Boys, covering the song ""Wipe Out"" and filming a video for it. They scored their first #1 in 22 years with the 1988 song ""Kokomo,"" which was featured on the soundtrack of the hit Tom Cruise movie Cocktail and which became their biggest-selling hit ever. In 1996 they guested with Status Quo on a re-recording of Fun, Fun, Fun, which was a British Top 30 hit.  Members of the band appeared on sitcoms such as Full House (starring sometimes drummer John Stamos) and Home Improvement in the 1990s, as well as touring occasionally, but their declining career contrasted dramatically with the massive public interest and rabid critical praise that followed Brian's gradual return to touring in the 1990s. The critically acclaimed documentary I Just Wasn't Made For These Times, important in restoring Wilson's reputation, saw him performing for the first time with his now adult daughters, Wendy and Carnie, and included glowing tributes to his talents from a host of major music stars of the '60s, '70s, and '80s.  Tragedy struck the Wilson family again in 1998 when Carl Wilson died of lung cancer. In 1997, while Carl was in the hospital fighting his cancer, David Marks rejoined the group, subbing for Carl. After Carl's death, Al Jardine was forced out of the group due to a conflict with Love. Brian Wilson was pursuing a solo career at the time, and had no desire to work with the Beach Boys. Permission was given to Mike Love to tour under the Beach Boys' name, and from 1998 to 2011, ""The Beach Boys"" consisted of Mike Love and Bruce Johnston. Marks toured with them from Carl's death until the summer of 1999, when he left the group due to health reasons. Their tours remained popular, even as they came to be viewed primarily as a nostalgia act. Meanwhile, Brian Wilson and Al Jardine each separately pursued solo careers with their new bands.  Setting aside differences  On June 13, 2006, the major surviving Beach Boys (Brian Wilson, Mike Love, Al Jardine, Bruce Johnston, and David Marks) all set aside their differences and reunited for a celebration of the 40th anniversary of the album Pet Sounds and the double-platinum certification of their greatest hits compilation, Sounds of Summer: The Very Best of the Beach Boys, in a ceremony atop the Capitol Records building in Hollywood. Plaques were awarded for their efforts to all major members, with Brian Wilson accepting for his late brothers Carl and Dennis.   Personnel changes through the years  From the start, The Beach Boys have undergone many variations in composition, being represented by fill-ins as often as not. Wilson neighbor David Marks appeared on their first four albums and was a member from 1962 to 1963 as a temporary replacement for Jardine, who had left the group to pursue a career in dentistry. Marks rejoined the band in 1997, during Carl Wilson's last illness, and remained with them for two years.  Glen Campbell toured for several months with the group in 1965, as a touring replacement for Brian, who had played bass in concert. Campbell was subsequently replaced by Bruce Johnston, who later became a permanent member. During the mid-1970s drummer Ricky Fataar and guitarist Blondie Chaplin joined the band.  Though not official members, The Beach Boys' supporting band has featured many notable musicians over the years. Keyboard player Daryl Dragon, later famous as half of the pop duo Captain & Tennille, toured with the band, along with his future wife Toni Tennille. Carli Muñoz, who had been playing percussion with the band since 1970, in 1971 replaced Daryl Dragon as keyboard player until 1981. Jeff Foskett joined the touring band in 1981 as a guitarist and vocalist and remained with the group until 1990, Foskett is currently a member of Brian Wilson's group. Billy Hinsche, of Dino, Desi, & Billy fame, was also a longtime member of the supporting band throughout the '70s, '80s, and '90s. Daryl Dragon's brother Dennis Dragon was a percussionist for the group in the early '70s. Bobby Figueroa was a drummer and percussionist for the Beach Boys in the 1970s and 80s. Mike Meros was a longtime keyboard player for the group, leaving in 2001 to join Alan Jardine's Endless Summer Band (Meros passed away in late 2007). Mike Kowalski was a longtime drummer for the band, starting his Beach Boys tenure in 1969, and continuing with the group throughout the '70s, '80s,' 90s, and '00s, only to leave in 2007. Ed Carter played guitar and bass for the group from 1969 through the late 1990s. Carter joined Al Jardine's Beach Boys Friends and Family in 1999.  Some of the changes in The Beach Boys' organization were less formal. They enjoyed a casual collaboration with fellow Southern Californians Jan And Dean. Much to the consternation of other band members, Wilson composed ""Surf City"" and gave the song, without compensation, to Dean Torrence. Jan and Dean, at the time not nearly as popular as The Beach Boys, recorded the song and scored their first number one single, long before the Beach Boys reached the same milestone. Years later, Torrence happened upon the studio where the Beach Boys were recording their ""Beach Boys' Party!"" album. He joined in the singing, and can be heard singing harmony in the ""Barbara Ann"" cut from that album.  After the death of Carl Wilson, Mike Love received permission from Brian Wilson, Al Jardine, and the estate of Carl Wilson to tour under the Beach Boys name. In 1998 and 1999, Mike Love, Bruce Johnston, and David Marks toured under this incarnation of the Beach Boys. In 1999, David Marks left so he could focus on fighting his Hepatitis C (He was fully cured in 2004.). From 1999 to 2011, Mike Love and Bruce Johnston have played up to 100 shows a year, sometimes more, under the Beach Boys banner.  To the surprise and delight of fans around the world, Brian Wilson has mounted several major tours under his own name with a band containing members of The Wondermints (Darian Sahanaja, Nick Walusko, and Probyn Gregory) and led by former Beach Boys guitarist Jeff Foskett plus other supporting musicians (Scott Bennett, Taylor Mills, Jim Hines, Paul Mertens, Nelson Bragg, Bob Lizik). Their note-perfect live performances of the entire Pet Sounds album earned some of the most glowing concert reviews of Wilson's career, with some commentators calling the shows ""the concert of a lifetime"". In 2003 and 2004, he and Van Dyke Parks reunited to complete the unfinished sections of Smile, and in 2004 Wilson and his band toured the world performing a live concert version of the album. They then recorded a new studio version of Smile using vintage recording equipment and including sessions at the fabled Sunset Sound Studios in Hollywood, where some of the original recordings were made.  In September of 2007, Wilson debuted a new work entitled That Lucky Old Sun, co-written with Van Dyke Parks and band member Scott Bennett, at the Royal Festival Hall in London. Wilson plans to record and release That Lucky Old Sun as a studio album in 2008.  Jardine toured for a while with the Beach Boys Family & Friends (which for legal reasons quickly became Alan Jardine Family & Friends Beach Band), featuring his sons Matt and Adam, Wilson's daughters Carnie and Wendy, former Beach Boys sidemen Ed Carter , Bobby Figueroa, and Carl's brother-in-law Billy Hinsche, among others. Jardine now tours as the Endless Summer Band which includes his two sons, Hinsche, and several other performers including members of the pop/rock band Tripsitter.  50th Anniversary  In December 2011, surviving members Brian Wilson, Mike Love, Al Jardine, David Marks, and Bruce Johnston reunited for a new studio album and an extensive 70-plus date ""50th Anniversary Celebration"" world tour. They used musicians from both Brian Wilson's solo band and Mike Love's touring ""Beach Boys"" as sidemen. The reunited Beach Boys played to enthusiastic crowds all over the world.   In 2012 Mike Love announced that he and Bruce Johnston had booked shows for their scaled down version of the Beach Boys. Wilson, Jardine, and Marks wanted to continue with the reunited line up, but for various reasons, Love did not.   In 2013, Mike Love and Bruce Johnston are continuing to tour under the Beach Boys name. Brian Wilson has been in the studio, it is not known whether the sessions are for the Beach Boys, or for Brian solo material. Brian Wilson also plans to play two shows with Al Jardine and David Marks, one show in Ohio, and the other at the Greek Theater in Los Angeles. A live album and/or DVD, and a career-spanning box set entitled ""Made In California"" are slated to be released sometime in 2013.

The group's original lineup consisted of brothers Brian, Dennis and Carl Wilson, their cousin Mike Love, and their friend Al Jardine. Emerging at the vanguard of the ""California Sound"", the band's early music gained international popularity for their distinct vocal harmonies and lyrics evoking a southern California youth culture of surfing, cars, and romance. Influenced by jazz-based vocal groups, 1950s rock and roll, and doo-wop, Brian led the band to experiment with several genres ranging from pop ballads to psychedelic and baroque while devising novel approaches to music production and arranging. While initially managed by the Wilsons' father Murry, Brian's creative ambitions and sophisticated songwriting abilities dominated the group's musical direction. 
Released in 1966, the Pet Sounds album and the ""Good Vibrations"" single featured an intricate and multi-layered sound that represented a departure from the simple surf rock of the Beach Boys' early years. Soon after the dissolution of Smile, Brian gradually ceded control to the rest of the band, reducing his input due to mental health and substance abuse issues. Though the more democratic incarnation of the Beach Boys recorded a string of albums in various musical styles that garnered international critical success, the group struggled to reclaim their commercial momentum in America. Since the 1980s, much-publicized legal wrangling over royalties, songwriting credits and use of the band's name transpired. Dennis drowned in 1983 and Carl died of lung cancer in 1998. After Carl's death, many live configurations of the band fronted by Mike Love and Bruce Johnston continued to tour into the 2000s while other members pursued solo projects. For the band's 50th anniversary, the surviving co-founders briefly reunited for a new studio album and world tour. 
The Beach Boys are often touted ""America's Band"", and AllMusic stated that their ""unerring ability...made them America's first, best rock band."" The group had over eighty songs chart worldwide, thirty-six of them United States Top 40 hits (the most by an American rock band), four reaching number-one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The Beach Boys have sold in excess of 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling bands of all time and are listed at number 12 on Rolling Stone magazine's 2004 list of the ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"". They have received one Grammy Award for The Smile Sessions (2011). The core quintet of the three Wilsons, Love and Jardine were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988. 

1958-66: Brian Wilson era:

Formation:

At the time of his sixteenth birthday on June 20, 1958, Brian Wilson shared a bedroom with his brothers, Dennis and Carl - aged thirteen and eleven, respectively - in their family home in Hawthorne. He had watched his father, Murry Wilson, play piano, and had listened intently to the harmonies of vocal groups such as the Four Freshmen. After dissecting songs such as ""Ivory Tower"" and ""Good News"", Brian would teach family members how to sing the background harmonies. For his birthday that year, Brian was given a reel-to-reel tape recorder. He learned how to overdub, using his vocals and those of Carl and their mother. Brian would play piano with Carl and David Marks, an eleven-year-old longtime neighbor, playing the guitars they had each received as Christmas presents. 
Soon Brian and Carl were avidly listening to Johnny Otis' KFOX radio show. Inspired by the simple structure and vocals of the rhythm and blues songs he heard, Brian changed his piano-playing style and started writing songs. His enthusiasm interfered with his music studies at school. Family gatherings brought the Wilsons in contact with cousin Mike Love. Brian taught Love's sister Maureen and a friend harmonies. Later, Brian, Mike Love and two friends performed at Hawthorne High School. Brian also knew Al Jardine, a high school classmate who had already played guitar in a folk group called the Islanders. Brian suggested to Jardine that they team up with his cousin and brother Carl. 
It was at these sessions, held in Brian's bedroom, that ""the Beach Boys sound"" began to form. Love encouraged Brian to write songs and gave the fledgling band its name: ""The Pendletones"", a portmanteau of ""Pendleton"", a style of woolen shirt popular at the time and ""tone"", the musical term. Although surfing motifs were very prominent in their early songs, Dennis was the only avid surfer in the group. He suggested that the group compose songs celebrating the sport and the lifestyle which had developed around it within Southern California. 

Jardine and a singer friend, Gary Winfrey, went to Brian to see if he could help out with a version of a folk song they wanted to record--""Sloop John B"". In Brian's absence, the two spoke with their father, a music industry veteran of modest success. Murry arranged for the Pendletones to meet his publisher, Hite Morgan. The group performed a slower ballad, ""Their Hearts Were Full of Spring"", but failed to impress Morgan. After an awkward pause, Dennis mentioned they had an original song, ""Surfin'"". Brian finished the song, and together with Mike Love, wrote ""Surfin' Safari"". The group rented guitars, drums, amplifiers and microphones, and practiced for three days while the Wilsons' parents were on a short vacation. 
In October 1961, the Pendletones recorded the two surfing song demos in twelve takes at Keen Recording Studio. Murry brought the demos to Herb Newman, owner of Candix Records and Era Records, and he signed the group on December 8, 1961. When the boys eagerly unpacked the first box of singles - released both under the Candix label, and also as a promo issue under X Records (Morgan's label) - they were shocked to see their band had been renamed as the Beach Boys. Murry Wilson called Morgan and learned that Candix wanted to name the group the Surfers to directly associate them with the increasingly popular teen sport. But Russ Regan, a young promoter with Era Records - who later became president of 20th Century Fox Records - noted that there already existed a group by that name, and he suggested calling them the Beach Boys. 

Beach-themed period:

Released in December 1961, ""Surfin'"" was soon aired on KFWB and KRLA, two of Los Angeles' most influential teen radio stations. It was a hit on the West Coast, going to number three in Southern California, and peaked at number 75 on the national pop charts. By the final weeks of 1961 ""Surfin'"" had sold more than 40,000 copies. By now the de facto manager of the Beach Boys, he landed the group's first paying gig (for which they earned $300) on New Year's Eve, 1961, at the Ritchie Valens Memorial Dance in Long Beach, headlined by Ike & Tina Turner. In their earliest public appearances, the band wore heavy wool jacket-like shirts which were favored by local surfers before switching to their trademark striped shirts and white pants 
Although Murry effectively seized managerial control of the band, Brian acknowledged that he ""deserves credit for getting us off the ground... he hounded us mercilessly... but also worked hard himself"". In the first half of February 1962, Jardine left the band and was replaced by Marks. The band recorded two more originals on April 19 at Western Studios, Los Angeles; ""Lonely Sea"" and ""409"", also re-recording ""Surfin' Safari"". On June 4, the band released their second single ""Surfin' Safari"" backed with ""409"". The release prompted national coverage in the June 9 issue of Billboard where the magazine praised Love's lead vocal and deemed the song to have strong hit potential. After being turned down by Dot and Liberty, the Beach Boys eventually signed a seven-year contract with Capitol Records on July 16 based on the strength of the June demo session. This was at the urging of Capitol exec Nik Venet who signed the group, finding them to be the ""teenage gold"" he had been scouting. By November, their first album was ready--Surfin' Safari which reached 32 on the US Billboard charts. Their song output continued along the same commercial line, focusing on California youth lifestyle. 
In January 1963, three months after the release of their debut album, the band began recording their sophomore effort, Surfin' U.S.A., a breakthrough for Brian, who began asserting himself as songwriter and arranger. The LP was the start of Brian's penchant for doubletracking vocals, a pioneering innovation which provided the Beach Boys with an exceptionally bright sound. Released on March 25, 1963, Surfin' U.S.A., met a more enthusiastic reception, reaching number two on the Billboard charts, propelling the band into a nationwide spotlight, and was vital to launching surf music as a national craze. Five days prior to the release of Surfin' U.S.A., Brian produced ""Surf City"", a song he had written for Jan and Dean. ""Surf City"" hit number one on the Billboard charts in July 1963, a development that pleased Brian but angered Murry, who felt his son had ""given away"" what should have been the Beach Boys' first chart-topper. 
At the beginning of a tour of the Mid-West in April 1963, Jardine rejoined the Beach Boys at Brian's request. As he began playing live gigs again, Brian left the road to focus on writing and recording. The result of this arrangement produced the albums Surfer Girl, released on September 16, 1963 and Little Deuce Coupe, released less than a month later on October 7, 1963. This sextet incarnation of the Beach Boys did not extend beyond these two albums, as Marks officially left the band in early October due to conflict with manager Murry, pulling Brian back into touring. 
Around this time, Brian began using members of the Wrecking Crew to augment his increasingly demanding studio arrangements. Session musicians that participated on Wilson's productions were said to have been awestruck by his musical abilities, as drummer Hal Blaine explained, ""We all studied in conservatories; we were trained musicians. We thought it was a fluke at first, but then we realized Brian was writing these incredible songs. This was not just a young kid writing about high school and surfing."" For composer Frank Zappa, the most exciting thing to him in ""white-person-music"" was when the Beach Boys used the progression V-II on ""Little Deuce Coupe"", calling it ""an important step forward by going backward."" A standalone Christmas-themed single, ""Little Saint Nick"", was released in December 1963, backed with an a capella rendition of the scriptural song ""The Lord's Prayer"". The A-side peaked at number 3 on the US Billboard Christmas chart. 
Following a successful Australasian tour in January and February 1964, the band returned home to face the British Invasion through the Beatles appearances on the Ed Sullivan Show. Signed to the same label as the Beach Boys, Capitol immediately began waning their support for the group, causing Murry to fight proactively for the band at the label more than before, often showing up to their offices in person without a call in advance in order to ""twist executive arms"". Brian reacted to the Beatles with pronounced bemusement: ""I was flipping out. I couldn't understand how a group could be just yelled and screamed at. The music they made, 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' for example, wasn't even that great a record, but they just screamed at it. ... It got us off our asses in the studio. We started cutting - we said 'look, don't worry about the Beatles, we'll cut our own stuff."" Reportedly, Brian wanted more time to complete their next album, yet Capitol insisted they finish recording swiftly to avoid being forgotten in the throes of the impending invasion. Satisfying these demands, the band hastily finished the sessions on February 20, 1964 and titled the album Shut Down Volume 2. ""Fun, Fun, Fun"" was released as a single from the album (backed with ""Why Do Fools Fall in Love"") and was a major hit. The LP, while containing several filler tracks, was propelled by other songs such as the melancholic ""The Warmth of the Sun"" and the advanced production style of ""Don't Worry Baby"". 
Brian soon wrote his last surf song in April 1964. That month, during recording of the single ""I Get Around"", Murry was relieved of his duties as manager. Brian reflected, ""We love the family thing - y'know: three brothers, a cousin and a friend is a really beautiful way to have a group - but the extra generation can become a hang-up"". When the single was released in May of that year, it would climb to number one, their first single to do so. Two months later, the album that the song later appeared on, All Summer Long, reached number four on the Billboard 200 charts. All Summer Long introduced exotic textures to the Beach Boys' sound exemplified by the piccolos and xylophones of its title track. The album was a swan-song to the surf and car music the Beach Boys built their commercial standing upon. Later albums took a different stylistic and lyrical path. Before this, a live album, Beach Boys Concert, was released in October to a four-week chart stay at number one, containing a setlist of previously recorded hits and covers that they hadn't yet recorded. 

Today! and Summer Days:
In June 1964, Brian began recording the bulk of The Beach Boys' Christmas Album with a forty-one-piece studio orchestra in collaboration with Four Freshmen arranger Dick Reynolds. Released in December, it was divided between five new, original Christmas-themed songs and seven reinterpretations of traditional Christmas songs. One single from the album, ""The Man with All the Toys"", was released, peaking at number 6 on the US Billboard Christmas chart. On October 29, the Beach Boys performed for The T.A.M.I. Show, a concert film intended to bring together a wide range of hit-making musicians for a one-off performance. The result was released to movie theaters one month later. 
By the end of the year, the stress of road travel, composing, producing and maintaining a high level of creativity became too much for Brian. On December 23, while on a flight from Los Angeles to Houston, he suffered a panic attack only hours after performing with the Beach Boys on the musical variety series Shindig!. In January 1965, he announced his withdrawal from touring to concentrate entirely on songwriting and record production. For the rest of 1964 and into 1965, Glen Campbell served as Wilson's temporary replacement in concert, until his own career success pulled him from the group in April 1965. Bruce Johnston was asked to locate a replacement for Campbell; having failed to find one, Johnston himself became a full-time member of the band on May 19, 1965, first replacing Brian on the road and later contributing in the studio, beginning with the vocal sessions for ""California Girls"" on June 4, 1965. 

After Brian relinquished touring in 1965, he became a full-time studio artist, showcasing a great leap forward with The Beach Boys Today!, an album containing a suite-like structure divided by songs and ballads which portended the Album Era with its cohesive artistic statement. During the recording sessions for Today!, Love told Melody Maker that he and the band wanted to look beyond surf rock and to avoid living in the past or resting on their laurels. The resulting LP had largely guitar-oriented pop songs such as ""Dance, Dance, Dance"" and ""Good to My Baby"" on side A with B-side ballads such as ""Please Let Me Wonder"" and ""She Knows Me Too Well"". 
Today! marked a maturation in the Beach Boys' lyric content by abandoning themes related to surfing, cars, or teenage love. Some love songs remained, but with a marked increase in depth, along with introspective tracks accompanied by adventurous and distinct arrangements. While the band's contemporaries grew more intellectually aware, Capitol continued to bill them as ""America's Top Surfin' Group!"", expecting Brian to write more surfing material for the yearly summer markets despite his disinterest. 
In June 1965, the band released Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!). The album included a reworked arrangement of ""Help Me, Rhonda"" which had become the band's second number one single in the spring of 1965, displacing the Beatles' ""Ticket to Ride"". ""Let Him Run Wild"" tapped into the youthful angst that would later pervade their music. In November 1965, the group followed up their US number-three-charting ""California Girls"" from Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!) with another top-twenty single, ""The Little Girl I Once Knew"". It was considered the band's most experimental statement thus far, using silence as a pre-chorus, clashing keyboards, moody brass and vocal tics. The single continued Brian's ambitions for daring arrangements, featuring unexpected tempo changes and numerous false endings. Perhaps too extreme an arrangement to go much higher than its number 20 peak, it was the band's second single not to reach the top ten since their 1962 breakthrough. 
Capitol demanded a Beach Boys LP for the 1965 Christmas season, and to appease them, Brian conceived Beach Boys' Party!, a live-in-the-studio album consisting mostly of acoustic covers of 1950s rock and R&B songs, in addition to covers of three Beatles songs, Bob Dylan's ""The Times They Are a-Changin'"", and idiosyncratic rerecordings of the group's earlier hits. In December they scored an unexpected number two hit (number three in the UK) with ""Barbara Ann"", which Capitol released as a single with no band input. Originally by the Regents, it became one of the Beach Boys' most recognized hits. 

Pet Sounds:

In 1966, the Beach Boys formally established their use of unconventional instruments and elaborate layers of vocal harmonies on their groundbreaking record Pet Sounds. It is considered Brian's most concise demonstration of his production and songwriting expertise. With songs such as ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"" and ""Sloop John B"", the album's innovative soundscape incorporates elements of pop, jazz, classical, exotica, and the avant-garde. The instrumentation combines found sounds such as bicycle bells and dog whistles with classically inspired orchestrations and the usual rock set-up of drums and guitars; among others, silverware, accordions, plucked piano strings, barking dogs, and plastic water jugs. For the basic rhythmic feel for ""God Only Knows"", harpsichord, piano with slapback echo, sleigh bells, and strings spilled into each other to create a rich blanket of sound. 
Pet Sounds is considered by some as a Brian Wilson solo album in all but name, as other members contributed relatively little to the compositions or recordings. Influenced by psychedelic drugs, Brian turned inward and probed his deep-seated self-doubts and emotional longings; the piece did not address the problems in the world around them, unlike other psychedelic rock groups. As Jim Miller wrote of the album's tone, ""It vented Wilson's obsession with isolation cataloging a forlorn quest for security. The whole enterprise, which smacked of song cycle pretensions, was streaked with regret and romantic langour."" According to Brian, the album was designed as a collection of art pieces which belong together yet could stand alone. 
Released in May, Pet Sounds eventually peaked at number eleven in the US and number two in the UK, an accomplishment which helped the Beach Boys become the strongest selling album act in the UK for the final quarter of 1966, dethroning the three-year reign of native bands such as the Beatles. Met with a lukewarm critical reception in the US,Pet Sounds was indifferently promoted by Capitol and failed to become the major hit Wilson had hoped it would be. Its failure to gain a wider recognition in the US combined with Capitol's decision to issue Best of The Beach Boys in July dispirited Brian, who considered Pet Sounds an extremely personal work. It was assumed that the label considered the album a risk, appealing more to an older demographic than the younger, female audience the Beach Boys built their commercial standing on.Pet Sounds sales numbered approximately 500,000 units, a significant drop-off from the chain of million-selling albums which immediately preceded it.Best of The Beach Boys was quickly certified Gold by the RIAA. 
In a 1972 review of Pet Sounds, music journalist Stephen Davis wrote, 

From first cut to last we were treated to an intense, linear personal vision of the vagaries of a love affair and the painful, introverted anxieties that are the wrenching precipitates of the unstable chemistry of any love relationship. This trenchant cycle of love songs has the emotional impact of a shatteringly evocative novel, and by God if this little record didn't change only the course of popular music, but the course of a few lives in the bargain. ... nobody was prepared for anything so soulful, so lovely, something one had to think about so much. 

Pet Sounds went on to be acknowledged as an important historical and cultural work, remaining today as an evocative release with distinctive lushness and melancholy. Beyond pop and rock, Pet Sounds expanded the field of music production. It was massively influential upon its release, vaunting the band to the top level of rock innovators. It is one of the earliest rock concept albums, one of the earliest concept albums of the counterculture era, and an early album in the emerging psychedelic rock style, signaling a turning point wherein rock, which previously had been considered dance music, became music that was made for listening to. 
In The Album: A Guide to Pop Music's Most Provocative, Influential, and Important Creations, author James Perone championed the album for its complex orchestrations, sophisticated compositions, and varied tone colors, calling it a remove from ""just about anything else that was going on in 1966 pop music."" In 1976, journalist Robin Denselow wrote: ""With the 1966 Pet Sounds album ... Wilson had become America's equivalent of the Beatles with his ability to expand the limits of popular taste.""Paul McCartney named it one of his favorite albums of all time on multiple occasions, calling it the primary impetus for the Beatles' album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967). In 2003, Pet Sounds was ranked second in ""The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time"" list selected by Rolling Stone, behind only Sgt. Pepper. 

""Good Vibrations"" and Smile:
Seeking to expand on Pet Sounds' advances, Wilson began an even more ambitious project: ""Good Vibrations"". Like Pet Sounds, Brian opted for an eclectic array of instruments rarely heard in pop music. Described by Brian as a ""pocket symphony,"" it contains a mixture of classical, rock, and exotic instruments structured around a cut-up mosaic of musical sections represented by several discordant key and modal shifts. It became the Beach Boys' biggest hit to date, and a US and UK number one single in 1966. Coming at a time when pop singles were usually made in under two hours, it was one of the most complex pop productions ever undertaken, and the most expensive single ever recorded to that point. The production costs were estimated between $50,000 and $75,000 ($360,000 and $550,000 today) with sessions for the song stretching over several months in at least four major studios. According to Domenic Priore, the making of ""Good Vibrations"" was unlike anything previous in the realms of classical, jazz, international, soundtrack, or any other kind of recording. 
The single was an unequivocal milestone in studio productions, and continued in establishing Brian as an extender of popular tastes. To the counterculture of the 1960s, ""Good Vibrations"" served as an anthem. Rock critic Gene Sculatti prophesied in 1968, ""It may yet prove to be the most significantly revolutionary piece of the current rock renaissance."" Its instrumentation included the Tannerin, an easier-to-manipulate version of a theremin, which helped the Beach Boys claim a new hippie audience. Upon release, the single prompted an unexpected revival in theremins while increasing awareness of analog synthesizers, leading Moog Music to produce their own brand of ribbon-controlled instruments. Reflecting on this period in 1971, Cue magazine wrote: ""In the year and a half that followed Pet Sounds, the Beach Boys were among the vanguard in practically every aspect of the counter culture - psychedelia, art rock, a return to roots, ecology, organic food, the cooled-out sound - anticipating changes that rock didn't accomplish until 1969-1970."" 
The group established a short-lived film production company, called Home Movies, during this time. It was supposed to have created live action film and television properties starring the Beach Boys. However, the company completed only one music video, for ""Good Vibrations"", though various other psychedelic sequences and segments exist. 

I'm doing the spiritual sound, a white spiritual sound. Religious music...That's the whole movement...That's where I'm going and it's going to scare a lot of people when I get there. 

--Brian Wilson quoted in Goodbye Surfing, Hello God! (1967), by Jules Siegel

Brian met musician and songwriter Van Dyke Parks while working on Pet Sounds. A year later, while in the midst of recording ""Good Vibrations"", the duo began an intense collaboration that resulted in a suite of challenging new songs for the Beach Boys‍ '​ forthcoming album Smile, intended to surpass Pet Sounds. Recording for the album spanned about a year, from 1966 to 1967. It is known that Wilson and Parks intended Smile to be a continuous suite of songs that were linked both thematically and musically, with the main songs being linked together by small vocal pieces and instrumental segments that elaborated upon the musical themes of the major songs. Surviving recordings have shown that the music incorporated chanting, cowboy songs, explorations in Indian and Hawaiian music, jazz, tone poems with classical elements, cartoon sound effects, musique concrète, and yodeling. 
Parks has stated: he and Brian were conscious of the counterculture, and the two had felt estranged from it, but it was necessary to adhere to due to a willingness to ""get out of the Eisenhower mindset."" Parks stresses, ""At the same time, he didn't want to lose that kind of gauche sensibility that he had. He was doing stuff that nobody would dream of doing,"" citing an instance when Brian instructed a banjo player to play only one string, a ""gauche"" style of playing that ""just wasn't done"". 
Smile would go on to become the most legendary unreleased album in the history of popular music. In the decades following its non-release, it became the subject of intense speculation and mystique. Many believe that, had the album been released, it would have substantially altered the group's direction and established them at the vanguard of rock innovators. Writing about the album for the 33⅓ book series, Luis Sanchez stated: ""If Brian Wilson and The Beach Boys were going to survive as the defining force of American pop music they were, Smile was a conscious attempt to rediscover the impulses and ideas that power American consciousness from the inside out. It was a collaboration that led to some incredible music, which, if it had been completed as an album and delivered to the public in 1966, might have had an incredible impact."" 
Many factors combined to put intense pressure on Brian Wilson as Smile neared completion: his mental instability, the pressure to create despite fierce internal opposition to his new music, the relatively unenthusiastic response to Pet Sounds in the United States, Carl Wilson's draft resistance, and a major dispute with Capitol Records. Furthermore, Wilson's reliance on both prescription drugs and amphetamines exacerbated his underlying mental health problems. Comparable to Brian Jones and Syd Barrett, Brian Wilson's use of psychedelic drugs--especially LSD--led to a nervous breakdown in the late-1960s. As his legend grew, the Smile period came to be seen as the pivotal episode in his decline, and he became tagged as one of the most notorious celebrity drug casualties of the rock era. 

1967-77: the Beach Boys as a democratic unit:

Smiley Smile and Wild Honey:
Some Smile tracks were salvaged and re-recorded in scaled-down versions at Brian's new home studio. Along with the single version of ""Good Vibrations"", these tracks were released on Smiley Smile, an album which elicited positive critical and commercial response abroad, but was the first real commercial failure for the group in the United States. By this time the Beach Boys' management (Nick Grillo and David Anderle) had created the band's own record label, Brother. One of the first labels to be owned by a rock group, Brother Records was intended for releases of Beach Boys side projects, and as an invitation to new talent. The initial output of the label, however, was limited to Smiley Smile and two resulting singles from the album; the failure of ""Gettin' Hungry"" caused the band to shelve Brother until 1970. Despite the cancellation of Smile, several tracks--including ""Our Prayer"", ""Cabin Essence"" and ""Surf's Up""--continued to trickle out in later albums often as filler songs to offset Brian's unwillingness to contribute. The band was still expecting to complete and release Smile as late as 1973 before it became clear that only Brian could comprehend the endless fragments that had been recorded.Smiley Smile was followed up three months later with Wild Honey, featuring songs written by Wilson and Love, including the hit ""Darlin'"" and a rendition of Stevie Wonder's ""I Was Made to Love Her"". The album fared better than its predecessor, reaching number 24 in the US. 

By 1967, the Beach Boys had become cultural dinosaurs. And it happened almost overnight....Monterey was a gathering place for the ""far out"" sounds of the ""new"" rock, and the Beach Boys in concert really had no exotic sounds to display. The net result of all their internal and external turmoil was that the Beach Boys didn't go...and it is thought that this non-appearance was what really turned the ""underground"" tide against them. 

--David Leaf

Compounding the group's recent setbacks, their public image took a cataclysmic hit following their withdrawal from the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival for the reason that they had no new material to play while their forthcoming single and album lay in limbo. Their cancellation was seen as ""a damning admission that they were washed up and unable to compete with the 'new music'"". This notion was exacerbated by Rolling Stone writer Jann Wenner, who in contemporary publications criticized Brian Wilson for his oft-repeated ""genius"" label which he called a ""promotional shuck"" and an attempt to compare with the Beatles. However, Wenner later responded to their Wild Honey album with more optimism, remarking two months later that ""in any case it's good to see that the Beach Boys are getting their heads straight once again"". 
While being interviewed in August 1967 for the failed live album Lei'd in Hawaii, Brian admitted: ""I think rock n' roll-the pop scene-is happening. It's great. But I think basically, the Beach Boys are squares. We're not happening."" Former band publicist Derek Taylor later recalled a conversation with Brian and Dennis where they denied that the group had ever written surf music or songs about cars, and that the Beach Boys had never been involved with the surf and hot rod fads, as Taylor claimed, ""...they would not concede."" As a result of their initial target demographic and subsequent failures to blend with the hippie movement, the group was viewed as unhip relics, even though they had once been, as biographer Peter Ames Carlin wrote, ""the absolute center of the American rock 'n' roll scene,"" a time when they had ushered the psychedelic era. In early 1969, Brian proposed that the group change their name from ""the Beach Boys"" to ""the Beach"", reasoning for the simple fact that the band members were now grown men. Going to the effort of acquiring a contract which would declare a five-way agreement to officially rename the group, Stephen Desper reported, ""They all just kind of shrugged and said, 'Aw, come on, Brian, we don't wanna do that. That's how the public knows us, man. And that was it. He put the paper on the piano and it stayed there until I picked it up and took it away."" 

Friends and 20/20:

After meeting Maharishi Mahesh Yogi at a UNICEF Variety Gala in Paris, France on December 15, 1967, Love, along with other high-profile celebrities such as Donovan and the Beatles traveled to Rishikesh in India during February and March 1968. The following Beach Boys album Friends (1968) had songs influenced by the Transcendental Meditation taught by the Maharishi. The album reached number 13 in the UK and 126 in the US, the title track placing at number 25 in the UK and number 47 in the US, the band's lowest singles peak since 1962. In support of the Friends album, Love had arranged for the Beach Boys to tour with the Maharishi in the US, which has been called ""one of the more bizarre entertainments of the era"". Starting on May 3, 1968, the tour lasted five shows and was cancelled when the Maharishi had to withdraw to fulfill film contracts. Due to disappointing audience numbers and the Maharishi's withdrawal, twenty-four tour dates were subsequently cancelled at a cost estimated at US$250,000 (approximately US$1,610,000 today) for the band. This tour was followed by the release of ""Do It Again"", a single which critics described as an update of the Beach Boys' surf rock past in a late-1960's style. The single went to the top of the Australian and UK single charts in 1968 and was moderately successful in the US, peaking at number 20. 
For a short time in mid-1968, Brian Wilson sought psychological treatment in hospital. During his absence, other members began writing and producing material themselves. To complete their contract with Capitol, they produced one more album. 20/20 (1969) was one of the group's most stylistically diverse albums, including hard rock songs such as ""All I Want to Do"", the waltz-based ""Time to Get Alone"" and a remake of the Ronettes' ""I Can Hear Music"". The diversity of genres have been described as an indicator that the group was trying to establish an updated identity. The album performed strongly in the UK, reaching number three on the charts. In the US, the album reached a modest 68. 
In spring 1968, Dennis began a strained relationship with musician Charles Manson which persisted for several months afterward. Dennis bought him time at Brian's home studio where recording sessions were attempted while Brian stayed in his room. It was then proposed by Dennis that Manson be signed to Brother Records, though Brian reportedly disliked Charlie, and so a deal was never made. Without Manson's involvement, the Beach Boys did record one song penned by Manson: ""Cease to Exist"" rewritten as ""Never Learn Not To Love"". The idea of the Beach Boys recording one of his songs reportedly thrilled Manson, and it was released as a Beach Boys single. After accruing a large monetary debt to the group, Dennis deliberately omitted Manson's credit on its release while also altering the song's arrangement and lyrics. This greatly angered Manson. Growing fearful, Dennis gradually distanced himself from Manson, whose family had taken over his home. He was eventually convicted for murder conspiracy; from there on, Dennis was too afraid of the Manson family to ever speak publicly on his relationship, let alone testify against him. 
On April 12, 1969, the band revisited their 1967 lawsuit against Capitol Records after they alleged an audit undertaken revealed the band were owed over US$2,000,000 (US$12,860,000 today) for unpaid royalties and production duties. The band's contract with Capitol Records expired on June 30, 1969, after which Capitol Records deleted the Beach Boys' catalog from print, effectively cutting off their royalty flow. In November 1969, Murry Wilson sold Sea of Tunes, the Beach Boys' catalogue, to Irving Almo Music, a decision which according to Marilyn Wilson ""devastated Brian"". In late 1969, the Beach Boys reactivated their Brother label and signed with Reprise. Around this time, the band commenced recording for a new album. At the time the Beach Boys tenure ended with Capitol in 1969, they had sold 65 million records worldwide, closing the decade as the most commercially successful American group in popular music. 

Sunflower, Surf's Up, ""So Tough"", and Holland:

In 1970, armed with the new Reprise contract, the band appeared rejuvenated, releasing the album Sunflower to critical acclaim in the UK but indifference in the US. The album features a strong group presence with significant writing contributions from all band members. Brian was active during this period, writing or co-writing seven of the twelve songs on Sunflower and performing at half of the band's domestic concerts in 1970. Sunflower reached number 29 in the UK and number 151 in the US, the band's lowest domestic chart showing to that point. A version of ""Cottonfields"" arranged by Al Jardine appeared on European releases of Sunflower and as a single, reached number one in Australia, Norway, South Africa and Sweden and the top-five in six other countries, including the UK. 
After Sunflower, the band hired Jack Rieley as their manager. Under Rieley's management, the group's music began emphasizing political and social awareness. During this time, Carl Wilson gradually assumed leadership of the band and Rieley contributed lyrics. On August 30, 1971 the band released Surf's Up, named after the Brian Wilson/Van Dyke Parks composition ""Surf's Up"". The album was moderately successful, reaching the US top 30, a marked improvement over their recent releases. While the record charted, the Beach Boys added to their renewed fame by performing a near-sellout set at Carnegie Hall, followed by an appearance with the Grateful Dead at Fillmore East on April 27, 1971. The live shows during this era included reworked arrangements of many of the band's previous songs. A large portion of their set lists culled from Pet Sounds and Smile, as author Domenic Priore observes, ""They basically played what they could have played at the Monterey Pop Festival in the summer of 1967."" 

Johnston ended his first stint with the band shortly after Surf's Up's release, reportedly because of friction with Rieley. At Carl's suggestion, the addition of Ricky Fataar and Blondie Chaplin in February 1972 led to a dramatic restructuring in the band's sound. The album Carl and the Passions - ""So Tough"" was an uncharacteristic mix that included two songs written by Fataar and Chaplin. 
For their next project the band, their families, assorted associates and technicians moved to the Netherlands for the summer of 1972. They rented a farmhouse to convert into a makeshift studio where recording sessions for the new project would take place. By the end of their sessions, the band felt they had produced one of their strongest efforts yet. Reprise, however, felt that the album required a strong single. This resulted in the song ""Sail On, Sailor"", a collaboration between Brian Wilson, Tandyn Almer, Ray Kennedy, Jack Rieley and Van Dyke Parks featuring a soulful lead vocal by Chaplin. Reprise subsequently approved and the resulting album, Holland, was released early in 1973, peaking at number 37. Brian's musical children story, Mount Vernon and Fairway (A Fairy Tale), narrated by Rieley and strongly influenced by Randy Newman's Sail Away (1972), was included as a bonus EP. Despite indifference from Reprise, the band's concert audience started to grow. 
The Beach Boys in Concert, a double album documenting the 1972 and 1973 US tours, was another top-30 album and became the band's first gold record under Reprise. During this period the band established itself as one of America's most popular live acts. Chaplin and Fataar helped organize the concerts to obtain a high quality live performance, playing material off Surf's Up, Carl and the Passions and Holland and adding songs from their older catalog. This concert arrangement lifted them back into American public prominence. In late 1973, the 41-song soundtrack to American Graffiti was released including the band's early songs ""Surfin' Safari"" and ""All Summer Long"". The album was a catalyst in creating a wave of nostalgia that reintroduced the Beach Boys into contemporary American consciousness. In 1974, Capitol Records issued Endless Summer, the band's first major pre-Pet Sounds greatest hits package. The compilation surged to the top of the Billboard album charts and was the group's first multi-million selling record since ""Good Vibrations"". It remained on the charts for two years. Capitol followed with a second compilation, Spirit of America, which also sold well. With these compilations, the Beach Boys became one of the most popular acts in rock, propelling themselves from opening for Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young to headliners selling out basketball arenas in a matter of weeks.Rolling Stone named the Beach Boys the ""Band of the Year"" for 1974, solely on the basis of their juggernaut touring schedule and material written over a decade earlier. 
Rieley, who remained in the Netherlands after Holland‍ '​s release, was relieved of his managerial duties in late 1973. Chaplin also left in late 1973 after an argument with Steve Love, the band's business manager (and Mike's brother). Fataar remained until 1974, when he was offered a chance to join a new group led by future Eagles member Joe Walsh. Chaplin's replacement, James William Guercio, started offering the group career advice that resulted in his becoming their new manager. Under Guercio, the Beach Boys staged a highly successful 1975 joint concert tour with Chicago, with each group performing some of the other's songs, including their previous year's collaboration on Chicago's hit ""Wishing You Were Here"". Beach Boys vocals were also heard on Elton John's 1974 hit ""Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me"". Nostalgia had settled into the Beach Boys' hype; the group had not officially released any new material since 1973's Holland. While their concerts continuously sold out, the stage act slowly changed from a contemporary presentation followed by oldies encores to an entire show made up of mostly pre-1967 music. 

15 Big Ones and Love You:

Recorded in the wake of California Music's demise, a supergroup which would have involved Brian Wilson, Bruce Johnston, and record producer Terry Melcher,15 Big Ones (1976) marked Brian's return as a major force in the group. The album included new songs by Brian, as well as cover versions of oldies such as ""Rock and Roll Music"", ""Blueberry Hill"", and ""In the Still of the Night"". ""Rock and Roll Music"" peaked at number 5 in the US. Brian and Love's ""It's O.K."" was in the vein of their early sixties style and was a moderate hit. The album was publicized by an August 1976 NBC-TV special, simply titled ""The Beach Boys"". The special, produced by Saturday Night Live (SNL) creator Lorne Michaels, featured appearances by SNL cast members John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd. 

The album was generally disliked by fans and critics upon release. During its sessions, Brian's production role was belittled as group members overdubbed and remixed tracks to fight against his desire for a rough, unfinished sound. Carl and Dennis disparaged the album to the press while Brian admitted ""undoubtedly the new album is nothing too deep,"" but remained hopeful that their next release would be on par with the group's ""Good Vibrations"". 
For the remainder of 1976 to early 1977, Brian spent his time making sporadic public appearances and producing the band's next album Love You (1977), a quirky collection of 14 songs mostly written, arranged and produced by Brian. Brian revealed to Peter Ames Carlin that Love You is one of his favorite Beach Boys releases, telling him ""That's when it all happened for me. That's where my heart lies.""Love You peaked at number 28 in the UK and number 53 in the US and developed a cult following; regarded as one of the band's best albums by fans and critics alike, and an early work of synthpop. 

""A diseased bunch of motherfuckers if ever there was one ... But the miracle is that the Beach Boys have made that disease sound like the literal babyflesh pink of health ... Maybe it's just that unprickable and ingenuous wholesomeness that accounts not only for their charm, but for their beauty--a beauty so awesome that listening to them at their best is like being in some vast dream cathedral decorated with a thousand gleaming American pop culture icons."" 

--Lester Bangs in a review of Love You for Circus, June 9, 1977.

Referring to ""naysayers"" of the album, the underground fanzine Scram wrote ""fuck them ... the album showcases a truly original mix of humor and sadness. The original numbers always dance just a step away from the cliché, dealing with simple lyrical themes that make you wonder why they had never been explored before.""The A.V. Club - considering the album to be in ""the same vein"" as Tonight's the Night (1975), Pussy Cats (1974), The Madcap Laughs (1970), and Barrett (1970) - described Love You: ""something almost desperately optimistic ... Wilson sings frayed songs about roller-skating, road-tripping, and Johnny Carson--like a frazzled man sitting in a corner chanting 'calm blue ocean' over and over. It's a beautiful, noisy, funny, heartbreaking work of art--one not for everybody, yet vital for anyone who wants to understand Wilson's overall worldview."" 
After Love You was released, Brian began to record and assemble Adult/Child, an unreleased effort largely consisting of songs written by Wilson from 1976 and 1977 with select big band arrangements by Dick Reynolds. Though publicized as the Beach Boys' next release, Adult/Child caused tension within the group and was ultimately shelved. Following this period, his concert appearances with the band gradually diminished and their performances were occasionally erratic. 
The internal wrangling came to a head after a show at Central Park on September 1, 1977, when the band effectively split into two camps; Dennis and Carl Wilson on one side, Mike Love and Al Jardine on the other with Brian remaining neutral. Following a confrontation on an airport tarmac, Dennis declared to Rolling Stone on September 3 that he had left the band: ""It was Al Jardine who really knifed me in the heart when he said they didn't need me. That was the clincher. And all I told him was that he couldn't play more than four chords. They kept telling me I had my solo album now Pacific Ocean Blue, like I should go off in a corner and leave the Beach Boys to them. The album really bothers them. They don't like to admit it's doing so well; they never even acknowledge it in interviews."" 
The band broke up for two and a half weeks, until a meeting on September 17 at Brian's house. In light of a potential new Caribou Records contract the parties negotiated a settlement resulting in Love gaining control of Brian's vote in the group, allowing Love and Jardine to outvote Carl and Dennis Wilson on any matter. 

1978-present:

Intergroup struggles:
The Beach Boys' last album for Reprise, M.I.U. Album (1978), was recorded at Maharishi International University in Iowa at the suggestion of Love. Dennis and Carl made limited contributions; the album was mostly produced by Jardine and Ron Altbach, with Brian credited as ""executive producer"".M.I.U. was largely a contractual obligation to finish out their association with Reprise, who likewise did not promote the result. The record cemented the divisions in the group. Love and Jardine focused on rock and roll-oriented material while Carl and Dennis chose the progressive focus they had established with the albums Carl and the Passions and Holland. 
Dennis withdrew from the group to focus on his second solo album entitled Bambu. The album was shelved just as alcoholism and marital problems overcame all three Wilson brothers. Carl appeared intoxicated during concerts (especially at appearances for their 1978 Australia tour) and Brian gradually slid back into addiction and an unhealthy lifestyle. 
After departing Reprise, the Beach Boys signed with CBS Records. They received a substantial advance and were paid $1 million per album even as CBS deemed their preliminary review of the band's first product, L.A. (Light Album) as unsatisfactory. Faced with the realization that Brian was unable to contribute, the band recruited Johnston as producer. The result paid off, as ""Good Timin'"" became a top 40 single. The group enjoyed moderate success with a disco reworking of the Wild Honey song ""Here Comes the Night"" which was followed by their highest charting UK single in nine years: Jardine's ""Lady Lynda"" peaked at number 6 in the UK Singles Chart. The album was followed in 1980 by Keepin' the Summer Alive, with Johnston once again producing. Barring an appearance on percussion on the closing track, ""Endless Harmony"", Dennis was absent from this album. 
In 1981, Carl quit the group due to unhappiness with the band's nostalgia format and lackluster live performances, subsequently pursuing a solo career. He returned in May 1982 - after approximately 14 months of being away - on the condition that the group reconsider their rehearsal and touring policies, along with refraining from ""Las Vegas-type engagements"". 

From 1980 through 1982, the Beach Boys and The Grass Roots performed Independence Day concerts at the National Mall in Washington, D.C., attracting large crowds. However, in April 1983, James G. Watt, President Ronald Reagan's Secretary of the Interior, banned Independence Day concerts on the Mall by such groups. Watt said that ""rock bands"" that had performed on the Mall on Independence Day in 1981 and 1982 had encouraged drug use and alcoholism and had attracted ""the wrong element"", who would mug attendees. During the ensuing uproar, which included over 40,000 complaints to the Department of the Interior, the Beach Boys stated that the Soviet Union, which had invited them to perform in Leningrad in 1978, ""obviously ... did not feel that the group attracted the wrong element"". Vice President George H. W. Bush said of the Beach Boys, ""They're my friends and I like their music"". Watt later apologized to the band after learning that President Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan were fans. White House staff presented Watt with a plaster foot with a hole in it, showing that he had ""shot himself in the foot"". The band returned to D.C. for Independence Day in 1984 and performed to a crowd of 750,000 people. 

Deaths of Dennis and Carl:
Dennis' ongoing personal problems kept him out of the group's activities. His alcoholism continued to escalate, and on December 28, 1983, he drowned in Marina del Rey while diving from a friend's boat trying to recover items he had previously thrown overboard in fits of rage. Despite his death, the Beach Boys continued as a successful touring act. 
On July 4, 1985, the Beach Boys played to an afternoon crowd of one million in Philadelphia and the same evening they performed for over 750,000 people on the Mall in Washington (the day's historic achievement was recorded in the Guinness Book of World Records). They also appeared nine days later at the Live Aid concert. That year, they released the eponymous album The Beach Boys and enjoyed a resurgence of interest later in the 1980s, assisted by tributes such as David Lee Roth's hit version of ""California Girls"". ""Getcha Back"", released from the album, gave the group a number 26 single in the US. Following this, the group put out ""Rock 'n' Roll to the Rescue"" (US, number 68) and a cover of the Mamas & the Papas' ""California Dreamin' (US, number 57). In 1987, they played with the rap group The Fat Boys, performing the song ""Wipe Out"" and filming a music video. It was a number 12 single in the US. and a number two rank in the UK. 
By 1988, Brian had drifted from the Beach Boys and released his first solo album, Brian Wilson, which received critical acclaim. During this period the band unexpectedly claimed their first US number one hit single in 22 years with ""Kokomo"", which had appeared in the movie Cocktail, and soon became the band's largest selling single of all time. Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame earlier in the year, the group became the second artist after Aretha Franklin to hit number one in the US after their induction. They released the album Still Cruisin', which went gold in the US and gave them their best chart showing since 1976. In 1990, the band gathered several studio musicians and recorded the Melcher-produced title track of the comedy Problem Child. The album Summer in Paradise, having no new contributions from Brian due to interference from caretaker Eugene Landy, was released two years later to a poor critical reception, and was a commercial disaster. 
A lawsuit was filed by Brian in 1989 to reclaim the rights to his songs and the group's publishing company, Sea of Tunes, which he had supposedly signed away to his father Murry in 1969. He successfully argued that he had not been mentally fit to make an informed decision and that his father had potentially forged his signature. While Wilson failed to regain his copyrights, he was awarded $25 million for unpaid royalties. Soon after Wilson won his case, Love discovered that Murry Wilson had not properly credited him as co-writer on 79 Beach Boys songs. With Love and Brian unable to determine exactly what Love was properly owed, Love sued Brian in 1992, winning $13 million in 1994 for lost royalties. 35 of the group's songs were then amended to credit Love. 
In 1993, the band appeared in Michael Feeney Callan's film The Beach Boys Today, which included in-depth interviews with all members except Brian. Carl confided to Callan that Brian would record again with the band at some point in the near future. A few Beach Boys sessions devoted to new Brian Wilson compositions occurred during the mid-1990s, but they remain largely unreleased, and the album was quickly aborted due to tenuous relations. In February 1996, the Beach Boys guested with Status Quo on a re-recording of ""Fun, Fun, Fun"", which became a British Top-30 hit. In June, the group worked with comedian Jeff Foxworthy on the recording ""Howdy From Maui"", and eventually released Stars and Stripes Vol. 1 in August 1996. The album consisted of country renditions of several Beach Boys hits, performed by popular country artists such as Toby Keith and Willie Nelson. Brian, who was in a better mental state at the time, acted as co-producer. 
In early 1997, Carl was diagnosed with lung cancer and brain cancer after years of heavy smoking. Despite his terminal condition, Carl continued to perform with the band on its 1997 summer tour while undergoing chemotherapy. During performances, he sat on a stool and reportedly needed oxygen after every song. However, Carl was able to stand when he played on ""God Only Knows"". Carl died on February 6, 1998, two months after the death of the Wilsons' mother, Audree. 

Band split and name conflicts:

Following Carl's death, the remaining members splintered. Love, Johnston and former guitarist Marks continued to tour without Jardine, initially as ""America's Band"", but following several cancelled bookings under that name, they sought authorization through Brother Records Inc. (BRI) to tour as ""The Beach Boys"" and secured the necessary license. In turn Jardine began to tour regularly with his band dubbed ""Beach Boys: Family & Friends"" until he ran into legal issues for using the name without license; meanwhile, Jardine sued Love and Brian claiming that he had been excluded from their concerts. BRI, through its longtime attorney, Ed McPherson, sued Jardine in Federal Court. Jardine, in turn, counter-claimed against BRI for wrongful termination. BRI ultimately prevailed after several years. Love was allowed to continue to tour as The Beach Boys, while Jardine was prohibited from touring using any form of the name. 
Released from Landy's control, Brian Wilson sought different treatments for his illnesses that aided him in his solo career. He toured regularly with his backing band consisting of members of Wondermints and other LA/Chicago musicians. Marks also maintained a solo career. Their tours remained reliable draws, with Wilson and Jardine both remaining legal members of the Beach Boys organization and BRI. The surviving group members appeared as themselves for the 1998 documentary film Endless Harmony: The Beach Boys Story, directed by Alan Boyd. Following the success of 1997's The Pet Sounds Sessions, many compilations were then issued by Capitol containing new archival material: Endless Harmony Soundtrack (1998), Ultimate Christmas (1998), and Hawthorne, CA (2001). 
In 2004, Wilson recorded and released his solo album Brian Wilson Presents Smile, a reinterpretation of the Smile project that he initiated with the Beach Boys thirty-six years earlier. That September, Wilson issued a free CD through the Mail On Sunday that included Beach Boys songs he'd recently rerecorded, five of which he'd co-authored with Love. The 10 track compilation had 2.6 million copies distributed and prompted Love to file a lawsuit in November 2005; he claimed the promotion hurt the sales of the original recordings. Love's suit was dismissed in 2007 when a judge determined that there were no triable issues. 
On June 13, 2006, the five surviving Beach Boys (Wilson, Love, Jardine, Johnston, and Marks) appeared together for the celebration of the 40th anniversary of Pet Sounds and the double-platinum certification of their greatest hits compilation, Sounds of Summer: The Very Best of The Beach Boys, in a ceremony atop the Capitol Records building in Hollywood. Plaques were awarded for their efforts, with Wilson accepting on behalf of Dennis and Carl. Throughout the year, it was rumored that the band would reform to perform the Pet Sounds album live in its entirety in November. Ultimately, Wilson began a brief Pet Sounds tour with Jardine and no other group members. 

50th year reunion celebration:

On October 31, 2011, the Beach Boys released surviving 1960s recordings from Smile in the form of The Smile Sessions. The album--even in its incomplete form--garnered universal critical acclaim and experienced popular success, charting in both the Billboard US and UK Top 30. The band was rewarded with glowing reviews, including inclusion in Rolling Stone's Top 500 album list at number 381. The Smile Sessions went on to win Best Historical Album at the 2013 Grammy Awards. Brian Wilson personally accepted the award stating ""I guess Van Dyke and I were on to something after all."" 
In February 2011, the Beach Boys released ""Don't Fight the Sea"", a charity single to aid the victims of the 2011 Japan earthquake. The single, released on Jardine's 2011 album A Postcard From California featured Jardine, Wilson, Love and Johnston, with prerecorded vocals by Carl Wilson. Rumors then circulated regarding a potential 50th anniversary band reunion. 
On December 16, 2011, it was announced that Wilson, Love, Jardine, Johnston and Marks would reunite for a new album and 50th anniversary tour in 2012 to include a performance at the New Orleans Jazz Festival in April 2012. On February 12, 2012, the Beach Boys performed at the 2012 Grammy Awards, in what was billed as a ""special performance"" by organizers. It marked the group's first live performance to include Brian since 1996. The Beach Boys then appeared at the April 10, 2012, season opener for the Los Angeles Dodgers and performed ""Surfer Girl"" along with ""The Star-Spangled Banner"". In April, the new album's title was revealed as That's Why God Made the Radio. The first single from the album, the title track, made its national radio debut April 25, 2012, on ESPN's Mike and Mike in the Morning and was released on iTunes and other digital platforms on April 26.That's Why God Made the Radio debuted at number three on US charts, making US chart history by expanding the group's span of Billboard 200 top ten albums across 49 years and one week, passing the Beatles with 47 years of top ten albums. 
Later in 2012, the group released the Fifty Big Ones and Greatest Hits compilations along with reissues of 12 of their albums. The next year, the group released Live - The 50th Anniversary Tour a 41 song, 2-CD set documenting their 50th Anniversary Tour. While there were no definite plans, Brian stated that he would like to make another Beach Boys album following the world tour. In August 2013, the group released Made in California, a six disc collection featuring more than seven and a half hours of music, including more than 60 previously unreleased tracks, and concluding the Beach Boys' 50th anniversary campaign. That same year, former members of the Beach Boys touring band, Bobby Figueroa, Billy Hinsche, Ed Carter, Matt Jardine (son of Al Jardine), and Philip Bardowell (sometimes with Randell Kirsch and others) united to form California Surf, Incorporated, performing Beach Boy songs. 

Resumed band split:

In June 2012, Love announced additional touring dates which would not feature Wilson. Wilson then denied knowledge of these new dates. On October 5, Love announced in a self-written press release to the LA Times that the band would return to its pre-50th Reunion Tour lineup with him and Johnston touring as the Beach Boys without Wilson, Jardine, and Marks: 

I did not fire Brian Wilson from the Beach Boys. I cannot fire Brian Wilson from the Beach Boys ... I do not have such authority. And even if I did, I would never fire Brian Wilson from the Beach Boys. ... This tour was always envisioned as a limited run ... As the year went on, Brian and Al wanted to keep the 50th anniversary tour going beyond the 75 dates ... However ... we had already set up shows in smaller cities with ... the configuration that had been touring together every year for the last 13 years. Brian and Al would not be joining for these small market dates, as was long agreed upon. 

Four days later, Wilson and Jardine submitted a written response to the rumors stating: ""After Mike booked a couple of shows with Bruce, Al and I were, of course, disappointed. Then there was confusion in some markets when photos of me, Al and David and the 50th reunion band appeared on websites advertising his shows ... I was completely blindsided by his press release ... We hadn't even discussed as a band what we were going to do with all the offers that were coming in for more 50th shows."" Love accused Wilson's statements in this press release to be falsified by his agents, again affirming that the presupposed agreements were ""well-documented"", and that Wilson had halted further touring dates. On December 13, Wilson and Jardine played a Christmas show at which they performed the Beach Boys Christmas songs. Following this appearance, Wilson announced concert dates featuring himself, Jardine and Marks. Love and Johnston continued to perform under the Beach Boys name, while Wilson, Jardine, and Marks continued to tour as a trio, and a subsequent tour with guitarist Jeff Beck also included former Beach Boy Blondie Chaplin at select dates. Reflecting upon the band's reunion in 2013, Love stated: ""I had a wonderful experience being in the studio together. Brian has lost none of his ability to structure those melodies and chord progressions, and when we heard us singing together coming back over the speakers it sounded like 1965 again. Touring was more for the fans. ... It was a great experience, it had a term to it, and now everyone's going on with their ways of doing things."" 
Jardine, Marks, Johnston and Love appeared together at the 2014 Ella Awards Ceremony, where Love was honored for his work as a singer. Marks sang ""409"" in honor of Love while Jardine performed ""Help Me Rhonda"". They closed the show by performing ""Fun, Fun, Fun"". Wilson's long time band associate Jeff Foskett also appeared, but not Wilson. On May 15, 2014 the touring Beach Boys (Love and Johnston) announced a tour celebrating ""50 Years of 'Fun Fun Fun'"", named for their 1964 single. The tour featured the addition of Foskett, who replaced Mike's son Christian. Foskett left Wilson's band due to encumbering responsibilities, and hopes that Wilson and Love's band would someday converge, believing that the two Beach Boys don't ""personally have a problem with each other."" As of September 2014, Jardine has maintained that a continued reunion with the Beach Boys is ""really up to him Love ... He claims he didn't, that he fired us after the reunion ... He's a brilliant songwriter, and unfortunately he has brilliant lawyers. We wish him all the best, but doggonit, you know, we'd like to be Beach Boys, too. There you go."" As Jardine restates ""Love doesn't really want to work with us,"" biographer Jon Stebbins speculated that Love declined to continue working with the group due to the lesser control he had over the touring process, coupled with the lower financial gain, noting: ""Night after night after night after night, Mike is making less money getting reminded that Brian is more popular than him. And he has to answer to people instead of calling all the shots himself."" 
In 2015, Soundstage aired an episode featuring Wilson performing with Jardine and former Beach Boys Blondie Chaplin and Ricky Fataar at The Venetian in Las Vegas. In April 2015, when asked if he was interested in making music with Love again, Wilson replied: ""I don't think so, no."" 

Musical style and development:
See also: The Beach Boys lineups
In Understanding Rock: Essays in Musical Analysis, music theorist Daniel Harrison summarizes: 

Even from their inception, the Beach Boys were an experimental group. They combined, as Jim Miller has put it, ""the instrumental sleekness of the Ventures, the lyric sophistication of Chuck Berry, and the vocal expertise of some weird cross between the Lettermen and Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers"" with lyrics whos images, idioms, and concerns were drawn from the rarefied world of the middle-class white male southern California teenager. ... But it was the profound vocal virtuosity of the group, coupled with the obsessional drive and compositional ambitions of their leader, Brian Wilson, that promised their survival after the eventual breaking of fad fever. ... Comparison to other vocally oriented rock groups, such as the Association, shows the Beach Boys' technique to be far superior, almost embarrassingly so. They were so confident of their ability, and of Brian's skill as a producer to enhance it, that they were unafraid of doing sophisticated, a cappella glee-club arrangements containing multiple suspensions, passing formations, complex chords, and both chromatic and enharmonic modulations. 

Influenced by doo-wop and rhythm and blues, they began as a garage band playing 1950s style rock and roll. During their early years, the Beach Boys released music that displayed an increasing level of sophistication, a period where Brian Wilson consistently acted as the group's primary bandleader, songwriter, producer, and arranger for the group's most commercially and critically successful work. Together, the band reassembled styles of music such as surf to include vocal jazz harmony, creating their unique sound. In addition, they introduced their signature approach to common genres such as the pop ballad by applying harmonic or formal twists not native to rock and roll. Miller observed, ""On straight rockers they sang tight harmonies behind Love's lead ... on ballads, Brian played his falsetto off against lush, jazz-tinged voicings, often using (for rock) unorthodox harmonic structures."" Harrison adds, ""But even the least distinguished of the Beach Boys' early uptempo rock 'n' roll songs show traces of structural complexity at some level; Brian was simply too curious and experimental to leave convention alone."" This new sound was quickly associated with the Modernism movement blooming in the Los Angeles music scene. The band later went on to incorporate many genres, from baroque pop to psychedelia and synthpop. 
In early 1964, Brian began his breakaway from beach-themed music. Later in November of the same year, the group expressed desires to advance from the surf rock style for which they initially became known for. Experimentation with psychotropic substances proved pivotal to the group's development as artists. The following month, Brian was introduced to cannabis before quickly progressing to LSD in early 1965. Of his first acid trip, Brian recalled that the drug had subjected him to ""a very religious experience"" which enlightened him to indescribable philosophies. The music for ""California Girls"", the first Beach Boys song which Bruce Johnston participated in, came from this first LSD experience, as did much of the group's subsequent work where they would often partake in drug use during recording sessions. 
Brian is quoted saying: ""Everyone contributed something. Carl kept us hip to the latest tunes, Al taught us his repertoire of folk songs, and Dennis, though he didn't initially play anything, added a combustible spark just by his presence."" Early on, Love sang lead vocals in the rock-oriented songs, while Carl contributed crisp guitar lines on the group's ballads. In a 1966 article which asks ""Do the Beach Boys rely too much on sound genius Brian?"", Carl responded that every member of the group contributes ideas, but admitted that Brian was majorly responsible for their music. 

Influences:
Further information: List of songs covered by the Beach Boys
The band's earliest influences came primarily from the work of Chuck Berry and the Four Freshmen. Performed by the Four Freshmen, ""Their Hearts Were Full of Spring"" (1961) was a particular favorite of the group. By deconstructing their arrangements of pop standards, Brian educated himself on jazz harmony. Taking this into mind, Philip Lambert noted, ""If Bob Flanigan helped teach Brian how to sing, then Gershwin, Kern, Porter, and the other members of this pantheon helped him learn how to craft a song."" Other general influences on the group included the Hi-Los,the Penguins, the Robins, Bill Haley & His Comets, Otis Williams, the Cadets, the Everly Brothers, the Belmonts, the Shirelles, the Regents, and the Crystals. While the Beach Boys are not often associated with blues, Brian has called this a misapprehension, citing Smokey Robinson and Stevie Wonder as influences. Regarding surf rock pioneer Dick Dale, Brian clarified that his influence on the group was limited to Carl and his style of guitar playing. Carl himself named Berry, the Ventures, and John Walker for shaping his guitar style, and that the Beach Boys had learned to play all of the Ventures' songs by ear early in their career. 
The influence of the Beach Boys' peers combined with Brian's competitive nature drove him to reach higher creative peaks. Sometime around late 1963, he heard the song ""Be My Baby"" (1963) by the Ronettes for the first time, revamping his creative interests and songwriting. ""Be My Baby"" is considered the epitome of Phil Spector's Wall of Sound production technique, a recording method that would fascinate Wilson for the next several decades. Brian later reflected: ""I was unable to really think as a producer up until the time where I really got familiar with Phil Spector's work. That was when I started to design the experience to be a record rather than just a song."" He kept ""Be My Baby"" on his living room jukebox, and would listen to it whenever the mood struck him. According to engineer Larry Levine, ""Brian was one of the few people in the music business Phil respected. There was a mutual respect. Brian might say that he learned how to produce from watching Phil, but the truth is, he was already producing records before he observed Phil. He just wasn't getting credit for it, something that in the early days, I remember really used to make Phil angry. Phil would tell anybody who listened that Brian was one of the great producers."" 
Other prominent inspirations for Brian included Gershwin's ""Rhapsody in Blue"" (1924),the Beatles' Rubber Soul (1965), and composer Burt Bacharach. Author Domenic Priore wrote that, in a subtle way, Brian grew to appreciate the potential of what a pop song could do after being partially spurred on by the dynamics of Bacharach's ""Walk On By"" (1964), a song which would become just as influential to him as ""Be My Baby"", supporting his strive to achieve a sense of dynamics in his recordings while he began pulling away from a purely Spector-inspired approach to production. Brian supported this by saying, ""Burt Bacharach and Hal David are more like me. They're also the best pop team - per se - today. As a producer, Bacharach has a very fresh, new approach."" 

Vocal ability:
Brian identified each member individually for their vocal range, once detailing the ranges for Carl, Dennis, Jardine (""they progress upwards through G, A, and B"") Love (""can go from bass to the E above middle C""), and himself (""I can take the second D in the treble clef""). He declared in 1966 that his greatest interest was to expand modern vocal harmony, owing his fascination with voice to the Four Freshmen which he considered a ""groovy sectional sound"". He added, ""The harmonies that we are able to produce give us a uniqueness which is really the only important thing you can put into records - some quality that no one else has got. I love peaks in a song - and enhancing them on the control panel. Most of all, I love the human voice for its own sake."" Rock critic Erik Davis wrote, ""The 'purity' of tone and genetic proximity that smoothed their voices was almost creepy, pseudo-castrato, and a 'barbershop' sound."" According to Brian: ""Jack Good once told us, 'You sing like eunuchs in a Sistine Chapel,' which was a pretty good quote."" For a period, Brian avoided singing falsetto for the group, saying ""I thought people thought I was a fairy. ... The band told me, 'If that's the way you sing, don't worry about it.'"" 
From lowest intervals to highest, the group's vocal harmony stack usually began with Love or Dennis, followed by Jardine or Carl, and finally Brian on top. Jardine explains, ""We always sang the same vocal intervals. ... As soon as we heard the chords on the piano we'd figure it out pretty easily. If there was a vocal move Brian envisioned, he'd show that particular singer that move. We had somewhat photographic memory as far as the vocal parts were concerned so that never a problem for us."" Striving for absolute perfection, Brian's intricate vocal arrangements exercised the group's calculated blend of intonation, attack, phrasing, and expression. Sometimes, he would sing each vocal harmony part alone through multi-track tape.Jimmy Webb has said, ""They used very little vibrato and sing in very straight tones. The voices all lie down beside each other very easily - there's no bumping between them because the pitch is very precise."" 

As instrumentalists:

The group's instrumental combo initially involved Brian on bass guitar and keyboards, Carl on guitar, and Dennis on drums. From an early age, Brian demonstrated an extraordinary skill for learning music by ear on keyboard. Using major Hollywood recording studios, he arranged many of his compositions for a conglomerate of session musicians informally known as the Wrecking Crew. Their assistance was needed due to the increasingly complicated nature of the material. As a result, a number of songs do not credit the Beach Boys as instrumentalists, but nearly invariably as lead, harmony, or backing vocalists. It's the belief of Richie Unterberger that ""before session musicians took over most of the parts, the Beach Boys could play respectably gutsy surf rock as a self-contained unit."" In spite of this, Carl Wilson continued to play beside these musicians whenever he was available to attend sessions. In archivist Craig Slowinski's view, ""One should not sell short Carl's own contributions; the youngest Wilson had developed as a musician sufficiently to play alongside the horde of high-dollar session pros that big brother was now bringing into the studio. Carl's guitar playing was a key ingredient."" 

Songwriting and production:
See also: Brian Wilson's home studio and Brother Studios
Brian's experiments with his Wollensack tape recorder provide early examples of his flair for exotica and unusual percussive patterns and arranging ideas that he would recycle in later prominent work. Through attending Phil Spector's sessions sporadically, Brian learned how to act as a producer for records while being educated on the Wall of Sound process. From then on, Brian received some production advice from Jan Berry. As they collaborated on several hit singles written and produced for other artists, they recorded what would later be regarded the California Sound. The positive commercial response to Brian's structurally irregular and harmonically varied pop compositions gave him the prestige, resources, and courage to further his creative aspirations. He proceeded to explore many unusual combinations of instruments while emphasizing inventive percussion and progressively ambitious lyricism. 
Although he was often dubbed a perfectionist, Brian was an inexperienced musician, and his understanding was mostly self-taught. He handled most stages of the group's recording process from the beginning, despite Nik Venet being credited for producing their early recordings. With regards to Brian's mid 1960s productions, ethnomusicologist David Toop characterized his style as ""cartoon music and Disney influence mutating into avant-garde pop"". Before 1966, Brian's mastery of songwriting proved that he was capable of applying odd harmonic progressions, unexpected disruptions of hypermeter,jazz theory,tempo changes, metrical ambiguity, and unusual tone colors successfully within a pop context. He made on-the-spot decisions about notes, articulation, and timbre; composing at the mixing board and using the studio as a musical instrument. Sometimes he would write songs which had melodic lines played in different keys at the same time, which confused his session musicians. In most cases, he was forced to rely on outside collaborators when it came to adding lyricism to his compositions. It was at this stage that Brian usually worked with bandmate Mike Love whose assertive persona provided youthful swagger that contrasted Brian's explorations in romanticism and sensitivity. Luis Sanchez noted a pattern where Brian would spare surfing imagery when working with collaborators outside of his band's circle in the examples ""Lonely Sea"" and ""In My Room"". 
He preferred mixing live as performances were recorded, as opposed to mixing after the fact. He was open to changes suggested by others while recording, often taking advice and even incorporating apparent mistakes if they provided a useful or interesting alternative. He experimented with processed effects including varispeed, reverberation, slapback echo, and filtering signals through a Leslie speaker. Lyric collaborator Tony Asher remembers that in the 1960s: ""People would try whatever they could think of that was unexpected, just for its own sake...spend three days and call in a bunch of oboe players. Try an instrument just because nobody had ever used it, and in the end, it wasn't in the final mix. That never happened with Brian. He did the same kind of experimenting, not to see if he could accidentally stumble onto something unique, but he did these unique things because that's what he wanted to hear. And most of the time, it ended up on the record."" Once an instrumental track was completed, vocals would then be overdubbed by the group. On Surfin' U.S.A. (1963), Brian began doubletracking. As was practiced by other record producers from the 1960s, most of his mixes ended up in single-channel monaural, believing that varied stereo speaker placement took his control over the sound image away to the listener. 
Eschewing Capitol Studios which Brian considered inadequate, engineer Chuck Britz often collaborated with him at Western 3 of United Western Recorders, also serving as a buffer between Brian and the oft-berating Murry whenever he was present. Once Britz assembled a preliminary recording setup, Brian would take over the console, directing the instrumentalists from the booth using an intercom or verbal gestures after supplying them with chord charts which were sometimes written incorrectly. It's reported that even though Britz was responsible for setting up recording, Brian would then adjust his configuration to a large extent. Asher adds: ""As unorganized or even unproductive as he Brian could be in other situations, when he got into a recording session, you had the sense he had ideas that were gonna get away from him if he didn't get 'em done right away. He was willing to have people be relaxed and joke a little bit, but he wanted to get work done. And he sometimes lost his temper just a little bit if Chuck couldn't find a take."" At Gold Star Studios, Brian worked mainly with engineers Stan Ross and, with lesser frequency, Larry Levine. Ross said of Brian, ""he liked the sound Gold Star got on the instrumentation, but he did the voices elsewhere because we were limited to two or three tracks and that wasn't enough for voice overdubbing. ... The tracks were really rhythm pads that would be sweetened after the voices were put on."" 

As Brian's productions advanced, he became recognized for his pop artistry, vocal harmonization, incessant studio perfectionism, forward-thinking song structures, engineering and mixing know-how, and creative multitasking abilities. It was unusual among rock groups that Brian wrote his own arrangements. This included his own string orchestrations, which Asher referred to for their odd voicings and classical style. Session bassist Carol Kaye noted, ""We had to create instrumental parts for all the other groups we cut for, but not Brian. We were in awe of Brian."" Friend Danny Hutton expressed similar feelings while highlighting Brian's studio proficiency, citing what he believed to be an extraordinary talent at harnessing several different studio spaces while piecing together discrete instrumental patterns and timbres cohesively. He noted, ""Somebody could go in right after Brian's session and try to record, and they could never get the sound he got. There was a lot of subtle stuff he did. ... People don't talk that much about it. They always talk about his music. He was fabulous in the studio, in terms of getting sounds. You'd sit there, and that was him. He was just hands-on. He would change the reverb and the echo, and all of a sudden, something just - whoa! - got twice as big and fat."" 
Foreshadowed by Beach Boys' Party! (1965), much of the group's recordings from 1967 to 1970 displayed sparse instrumentation, a more relaxed ensemble, and a seeming inattention to production quality. Brian briefly experimented with musique concrete and minimalist rock approaches to music before retreating to his home recording studio to record ""manic"" material in the 1970s, enacting syncopated exercises and counterpoints layered on jittery eighth note tone clusters and loping shuffle grooves. During the infancy of Brian's home studio, the group was forced to improvise many technical aspects of recording. In one instance, they used an empty swimming pool as an echo chamber. 
When Brian abdicated from the group, the other members were forced to take a more active production role. This is believed to have faltered the quality of their music.Richie Unterberger believes that after the December 1967 release of Wild Honey, ""the Beach Boys were revealed as a group that, although capable of producing some fine and interesting music, were no longer innovators on the level of the Beatles and other figureheads."" The album marked the beginning of Carl's increased role as producer, who described it as ""music for Brian to cool out by,"" signaling a mellower approach which would pervade into the 1970s. In 1968, Dennis contributed original songs to Friends, revealing himself as a broodingly soulful songwriter and singer, while Bruce Johnston devised a moody instrumental, ""The Nearest Faraway Place"", for 20/20 the following year.Sunflower (1970) marked an end to the experimental songwriting and production phase initiated by Smiley Smile (1967). Of the albums between Surf's Up (1971) and Holland (1973), Daniel Harrison wrote that they ""contain a mixture of middle-of-the-road music entirely consonant with pop style during the early 1970s with a few oddities that proved that the desire to push beyond conventional boundaries was not dead."" While Harrison adamantly states ""1974 is the year in which the Beach Boys ceased to be a rock 'n' roll act and became an oldies act,""Love You (1977) is perceived by some as an oddity that sounds like no other record in their catalog with synthesizer-laden arrangements played almost entirely by Brian.

Cultural impact and influence:

Regarded by some critics as one of the greatest American rock groups and an important catalyst in the evolution of popular music, the Beach Boys are one of the most critically acclaimed, commercially successful, and widely influential bands of all time. The Beach Boys' sales estimates range from 100 to 350 million records worldwide, and have influenced artists spanning many genres and decades. The group's early songs made them major pop stars in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and other countries, having sixteen hit singles between 1962 and 1965. They were one of the few American bands formed prior to the 1964 British Invasion to continue their success. Among artists of the 1960s, they are one of few central figures in the histories of rock. 
Their early hits helped raise the profile of the state of California, creating its first major regional style with national significance, and establishing a musical identity for Southern California, as opposed to Hollywood. This also associated the band with surfing, hot-rod racing, and a contemporaneous teenage lifestyle and fantasy. There had been surf bands formed prior to the Beach Boys, but none which projected a world view as the Beach Boys did. The resultant ""California Sound"" later morphed itself to reflect a more musically ambitious and mature world view, becoming less to do with surfing and cars and more about social consciousness and political awareness. Between 1964 and 1969, it fueled innovation and transition, inspiring artists to tackle largely unmentioned themes such as sexual freedom, black pride, drugs, oppositional politics, and war. 
Brian's work is credited as a major innovation in the field of music production. According to Erik Davis, ""Not only did the Beach Boys write a soundtrack to the early '60s, but Brian let loose a delicate and joyful art pop unique in music history and presaged the mellowness so fundamental to '70s California pop.""The A.V. Club wrote that Brian was among ""studio rats ... that set the pace for how pop music could and should sound in the Flower Power era: at once starry-eyed and wistful."" Only 21-years-old when he received the freedom to produce his own records with total creative autonomy, he ignited an explosion of like-minded California producers, supplanting New York as the center of popular records, and becoming the first rock producer to use the studio as a discrete instrument. The Beach Boys were thus one of the first rock groups to exert studio control. 
The group was among early (or earliest) instigators of psychedelic rock,acid rock,art rock,art pop,progressive rock, and sunshine pop. They attracted a following from a great number of their pop or rock contemporaries during the 1960s, including the Beatles,the Rolling Stones,Harry Nilsson,Cream,George Martin,the Who,Pink Floyd,Lou Reed of The Velvet Underground, and Frank Zappa. Additionally, they influenced pioneering musicians for glam rock: David Bowie and Marc Bolan;krautrock: Faust,Kraftwerk;power pop: Big Star; and new wave: Talking Heads. 
The Beach Boys helped create power pop, and in the 1970s, they were paid homage by punk rockers such as Ramones,Patti Smith, and Lester Bangs. Partly in due to the Ramones, many acts which Stereogum called ""punk or punk-adjacent"" showcased influence from the Beach Boys: Slickee Boys, Agent Orange, Bad Religion, Shonen Knife, the Queers, Hi-Standard, the Donnas, M.O.D.. and the Vandals. The group eventually bore a strong influence on indie rock. Over the years, the group's songs have been the subject of many tribute albums, several of which are compiled from cover versions contributed by various artists from a wide range of backgrounds including Japanese noise, pop punk, rockabilly, and trip hop. 
In the 1990s, the Beach Boys received a resurgence of popularity with alternative rock groups and young record-buyers of independent music. According to Sean O'Hagan of the High Llamas, ""they stopped listening to indie records"" in favor of the Beach Boys. Bands who advocated for the band included founding members of the Elephant 6 Collective: Neutral Milk Hotel, the Olivia Tremor Control, the Apples in Stereo, and of Montreal. United by a shared love of the Beach Boys' music, they named Pet Sounds Studio in honor of the group. Other influenced artists who gained prominence in underground circles during the 1980s and 1990s include shoegaze band My Bloody Valentine,electronica outfits Daft Punk,Saint Etienne,The High Llamas,the Avalanches,Stereolab, and alternative rock musicians Radiohead,Sonic Youth,Frank Black of Pixies,Jim Reid of the Jesus and Mary Chain, and Paddy McAloon of Prefab Sprout. In Japan, their music affected the work of noise rock bands Seagull Screaming Kiss Her Kiss Her and Melt-Banana. 
Other 20th century artists influenced by the Beach Boys include ABBA,Rivers Cuomo of Weezer,Fleetwood Mac,Cheap Trick,Chicago,Elton John,Flipper's Guitar,Todd Rundgren,Keiichi Suzuki,Yo La Tengo,Tatsuro Yamashita,Yellow Magic Orchestra, and XTC. The Beach Boys' influence has continued to pervade in such millennial artists as Air,Animal Collective,Fleet Foxes,MGMT,Super Furry Animals, and Frank Ocean. 

Reappraisal:
Professor of cultural studies James M. Curtis wrote in 1987, 

... we can say that the Beach Boys represent the outlook and values of white Protestant Anglo-Saxon teenagers in the early sixties. Having said that, we immediately realize that they must mean much more than this. Their stability, their staying power, and their ability to attract new fans prove as much. 

Historian Darren R. Reid added in 2013, ""Imagine, if you will, a world in which the Beatles were known only for their early hits whilst The White Album or Abbey Road were of interest, or even known, only to the group's biggest fans, and you will have some grasp of how the Beach Boys' distorted public image has helped to bury their most important artistic works."" 

Throughout their career, the Beach Boys struggled with their public image and audiences. Musicologist Charlie Gillett explains, ""By 1965, the Beach Boys had become an American pop institution, but although they continued to cultivate a visual image in line with their name and early repertoire, there was a limit to how many different ways Wilson could celebrate the wonders of living in Southern California ... Originally, many serious pop fans dismissed the group as trashy pop for kids."" Their growing complexity caused their live performances to suffer in the mid 1960s, when the group began to be derided by audiences for their uniformed striped shirts compounded by low key reproductions of songs which demanded complicated orchestrations. Because of their early hits, which celebrated a politically unconscious youth culture, the group's legitimacy in rock music became an oft-repeated criticism toward the band. In 1970, the group ceased wearing matching uniforms on stage and began emphasizing political and social awareness. Drawing from their associations with Charles Manson and Ronald Reagan, Erik Davis observed, ""the Beach Boys may be the only bridge between those deranged poles. There is a wider range of political and aesthetic sentiments in their records than in any other band in those heady times--like the state of California, they expand and bloat and contradict themselves."" 
Despite the group's immense popularity and success, some consider that the extent of their contribution to Western music canon is undervalued. In 1967, Lou Reed famously wrote, ""Will none of the powers that be realize what Brian Wilson did with the chords?""Pitchfork Media posited, ""At some point, you learn that the Beach Boys weren't just a fun 1960s surf band with a run of singles that later came to be used in commercials; at their best, they were making capital-A Art. ... Once you've absorbed Pet Sounds, you find yourself going back through songs like ""Don't Worry Baby"", ""The Warmth of the Sun"", and ""I Get Around"", finding a deeper brilliance where you once heard only pop craftsmanship."" Discussing the 2011 release of The Smile Sessions, The Los Angeles Times wrote, ""...certainly every library of American recording history needs this; university composition departments, music professors, budding recording engineers and composers should study it."" 

I think a lot of critics punish the band for not going beyond ""Good Vibrations"" ... I think they love the band so much that they get crazy because we don't top ourselves. ... every time there's a new Beach Boy record it competes with so many old Beach Boy records on the radio. ... the audience is so young and they're reacting more to the Beach Boys sound-alike commercials on TV and the three or four really big, quadruple platinum repackage albums. I'm not down on any of that stuff, but ... growth in this business is tough 

--Bruce Johnston speaking to the Houston Chronicle, August 1982

Online publication NewMusicBox - which normally devotes itself to new American music that is outside the commercial mainstream - argued that the Beach Boys could never earn themselves ""the same pride of place in American music history held by other great innovators"" because of their mistaken reputation as a ""light-hearted party band that drooled over 'California Girls' while on a 'Surfing Safari'"" hampered not only by the over-saturation of their early songs being used in film, commercials, and other media, but also ""their latter-day cover-band-version-of-their-former-selves concert appearances"". Referring to the groups' reaction to the commercial success of their 1974 greatest hits compilation Endless Summer, Daniel Harrison writes, ""they returned to the beach, knowing they would never leave it again."" Erik Davis wrote that by 1990, ""the Beach Boys are either dead, deranged, or dinosaurs; their records are Eurocentric, square, unsampled; they've made too much money to merit hip revisionism."" From the same period, Jim Miller wrote, ""They have become a figment of their own past, prisoners of their unflagging popularity--incongruous emblems of a sunny myth of eternal youth belied by much of their own best music. ... The group is still largely identified with its hits from the early Sixties."" 
Harrison, however, contests that the group once produced work which could ""almost"" be considered art music in the Western classical tradition, and that group's innovations in the musical language of rock can be compared to those that introduced atonal and other nontraditional techniques into that classical tradition. He explains, ""The spirit of experimentation is just as palpable in Smiley Smile as it is in, say, Schoenberg's op. 11 piano pieces."" While the group ""went into the great void beyond,"" such notions were not widely acknowledged by rock audiences nor by the classically minded at the time. Harrison concludes: ""What influences could these innovations then have? The short answer is, not much. Smiley Smile, Wild Honey, Friends, and 20/20 sound like few other rock albums; they are sui generis. ... It must be remembered that the commercial failure of the Beach Boys' experiments was hardly motivation for imitation. In the end, we must conclude that the Beach Boys' late-1960s experiments were not reproducible."" 

Awards and honors:

The group routinely appears in the upper reaches of ranked lists such as ""The Top 1000 Albums of All Time"". Many of the group's songs and albums including The Beach Boys Today! (1965), Smiley Smile (1967), Sunflower (1970), and Surf's Up (1971) are featured in several lists devoted to the greatest of all time. The 1966 releases Pet Sounds and ""Good Vibrations"" frequently rank among the top of critics' lists of the greatest albums and singles of all time. In 2004, Pet Sounds was preserved in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress for being ""culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant."" On Acclaimed Music, ""Good Vibrations"" is ranked the third best song of all time, while ""God Only Knows"" is ranked twenty-first; the group itself is ranked eleven in its 1000 most recommended artists of all time. 
In 1966 and 1967, reader polls conducted by the UK magazine NME crowned the Beach Boys as the world's number one vocal group, ahead of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. In 1974, the Beach Boys were awarded ""Band of the Year"" by Rolling Stone. On December 30, 1980, the Beach Boys were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, located at 1500 Vine Street. The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988. Ten years later they were selected for the Vocal Group Hall of Fame. In 2001, the group received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked the Beach Boys number 12 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. Brian Wilson was inducted into the UK Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in November 2006.

Description and history:
Dawes is composed of brothers Taylor (guitars and vocals) and Griffin Goldsmith (drums), along with Wylie Gelber (bass) and Tay Strathairn (keyboards). 

Dawes was formed from the band Simon Dawes after the departure of co-songwriter Blake Mills, subsequently abandoning a post-punk sound in favor of folk rock. Dawes has been described as having a Laurel Canyon sound derived from artists such as Crosby, Stills, and Nash, Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. 
At the invitation of producer Jonathan Wilson, the band joined a local informal jam session that included Conor Oberst, The Black Crowes's Chris Robinson, and Benmont Tench. The band recorded their debut album, North Hills, in Laurel Canyon in a live setting to analog tape, resulting in a sound that Rolling Stone magazine called ""authentically vintage"".Wilco multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansone is also credited with appearing on the release. 
Original keyboardist Alex Casnoff left the band in late 2010, and was replaced by Tay Strathairn. The band made their television debut on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson on April 14, 2010. Dawes released their second album, Nothing Is Wrong, on June 7, 2011 and toured the US co-headlining with Blitzen Trapper. Dawes played alongside Jackson Browne at the Occupy Wall Street event in Liberty Park, on December 1, 2011. The band also appeared as themselves on the February 7, 2012 episode of the NBC television series Parenthood. 
In February 2013, the band released the single ""From a Window Seat"" from the 2013 album Stories Don't End on Red General Catalog and Hub Records.

Glenn de Randamie (6 August 1984), better known as Typhoon, is a Dutch rapper. He signed by Dutch hip-hop record label Top Notch. The rappers Blaxtar (brother) and O-Dog (brother) and the R&B singer Dinopha (younger sister) are Typhoon's relatives.  Currently Typhoon is performing with the Fakkelbrigade with Sticks, Rico, James and dj ART.  Typhoon's rap career started in 1999 at age 15 in the hip-hop crew Rudeteenz, together with Rico of Opgezwolle and his brother Blaxtar Three years later he made his solo debut on the collection album ""Vet verse flows"". His contributed to album with the tracks ""Het doek valt"" and ""Alea Iacta Est"".  Typhoon won the Grote Prijs van Nederland (Grand Prize of the Netherlands) in 2004 in the R&B/hip-hop category.  Soon after that he was signed by Top Notch.  Typhoon graduated from his high school (vwo level, pre-university secondary education) at the Agnieten College, location Carolus Clusius, in Zwolle. In 2005 he made 10 theme tracks for TV music station The Box, together with producer Nav. The themes were about topics like man/woman relations, religion, money, Dutch immigration policy, top-class sport, fame, ideals and sex.  In 2007 Typhoon released his debut album, titled ""Tussen Licht en Lucht"" (Between Light and Air). Typhoon travelled to Kenya for a development aid programme of the Edukans organisation. He spent 10 days in Nairobi with a group of young people from all of The Netherlands to have an important experience.   3.  the French psychedelic trance act called Typhoon was active from around 1995 until 2000.

On August 4, 2011, Typhoon made their television debut on Late Show with David Letterman, performing ""The Honest Truth"". 

Music:
Typhoon's music is marked by complicated arrangements and careful orchestration. Live performances routinely involve 12 or more band members playing at once. According to Lauren Rosenthal at mySpoonful which describes new music: ""The group masterfully combines indie rock instrumentals and vocals with violins, percussion, hand claps, xylophone, horns and a choir of other instruments, making for inspiring and catchy songs."" The indie rock band out of Portland, Oregon emulates sounds similar to Frightened Rabbit, Bright Eyes, Beirut, and Arcade Fire.  
Their early recordings reveal a greater degree of experimentation with various styles, including a number of ""sea shanties"", country western and Eastern European-inspired songs. Their more recent output, including their album Hunger & Thirst and its companion EP, A New Kind of House, show a more focused and consistent sound, and a greater focus on creating a cohesive thematic through-line. Many of the songs are preoccupied with mortality and directly reference lead singer and primary songwriter Kyle Morton's own struggle with Lyme Disease as a child. 
In 2010 Typhoon was voted number two on Willamette Week's annual list of the top ten best new bands in Portland. Their music has appeared on the SyFy series Being Human and the NBC series Chuck. They have opened for The Thermals, Quasi, Yann Tiersen, Explosions in the Sky, The Decemberists, and The Shins and toured with Lady Lamb the Beekeeper. Their song ""The Honest Truth"" was ranked #3 in Paste magazine's list of the 50 best songs of 2011.

That same year, they won the prestigious Barclaycard Mercury Prize for An Awesome Wave.  On January 2014, Sainsbury announced that he had left the band. ""Hunger of the Pine"" premièred in June, as an advance of their sophomore album This Is All Yours released at the end of September.  http://altjband.com, alt-J (also known as ∆) is an English indie rock band formed in 2007 in Leeds, by Gwil Sainsbury (guitar/bass), Joe Newman (guitar/lead vocals), Gus Unger-Hamilton (keyboards/vocals) and Thom Green (drums). 
The band's debut album An Awesome Wave was released in May 2012 in Europe and September 2012 in the United States, and won the 2012 British Mercury Prize. Gwil Sainsbury amicably departed the band in early 2014. Their second album, This Is All Yours, was released on 22 September 2014 and went straight to UK number one. As a replacement for Sainsbury, Cameron Knight became a support member for alt-J's live shows, playing guitar, bass and sampler. 

History:

Formation and early years: 2007-10:
alt-J (∆) was formed when Gwil Sainsbury (guitar/bass), Joe Newman (guitar/lead vocals), Gus Unger-Hamilton (keyboards/vocals) and Thom Green (drums) met at Leeds University in 2007. Unger-Hamilton (younger brother of Ferdy, head of A&R for Polydor Records) studied English, the other three Fine Art. According to Newman ""I basically went to art school to start a band."" 
In their second year of studies, Newman showed Sainsbury a handful of his own songs and, inspired by his guitar-playing dad, the pair began recording on GarageBand in their hall rooms with Sainsbury acting as producer. The band's unusual sound stems from the fact that due to living in student halls, where noise had to be kept to a minimum, they were unable to use bass guitars or bass drums. Thom Green suffers from Alport syndrome, a rare genetic disease which causes hearing and kidney failure. As a result, he is now about 80 percent deaf. 

An Awesome Wave and touring: 2011-12:
After graduating the band moved to Cambridge, where they spent a number of months working on their music before signing a deal with Infectious Records in December 2011. Their self-titled 4-track demo EP, ∆, was recorded with producer Charlie Andrew in London and featured the tracks ""Breezeblocks"", ""Hand-Made"", ""Matilda"", and ""Tessellate"". A 7"" single containing ""Bloodflood"" and ""Tessellate"" was released by Loud and Quiet in October 2011. Their first 2012 release for Infectious Records was the triangle-shaped 10"" ""Matilda""/""Fitzpleasure"". It was followed by ""Breezeblocks"" which preceded their first album.An Awesome Wave was also produced by Charlie Andrew and compiled at Iguana Studios, Brixton, where the band recorded tracks during the studio's spare time. Their debut album was released on 28 May 2012 in the UK, Europe, and Australia, and on 18 September 2012 in North America via Canvasback Music. The album received largely favourable reviews and was described as a ""captivating blend of insatiable grooves and profound poignancy"". 
alt-J supported Wild Beasts in April 2012 and played a minor headlining tour around the United Kingdom and Ireland in October of that year. The band have featured regularly on summer festivals, including Latitude, Bestival, Reading and Leeds, T in the Park, Green Man, Pukkelpop, and Lowlands. They also did concert tour in the United States in December 2012 and performed at the Laneway Festival tour in Australia. In November 2012 the band were announced as the winners of the Mercury Prize for their album. Besides the prize-money, the band saw an increase in their profile resulting in An Awesome Wave reaching 13 in the UK album chart. The band would later descirbe the event as ""life-changing, there was a sense of being imposters, that the band had somehow got this far without not being a real band, we're just guys from Leeds who muddled through it and magicked a Mercury award"". 

Departure of Sainsbury and This Is All Yours: 2013-present:
Gwil Sainsbury left alt-J as of 13 January 2014. It was announced on Twitter that he had decided to leave, but the band would continue, stating that they were to still be best friends with Gwil. In early June 2014, alt-J announced a 2014 tour to take place in North America over October and November. The 23-day tour started in Vancouver, B.C. on October 14 and ended in Washington, D.C. on November 19. On 9 June 2014, they announced their second album This Is All Yours, that was released on 22 September 2014. This Is All Yours went straight to Number 1 on the UK's Official Albums Chart. It was announced that Alt-J will headline the September 2015 edition of Boston Calling Music Festival. 

Name:
The band's symbol is the delta sign, ∆, which is traditionally used in scientific study to indicate ""change"" or ""difference"". The ∆ symbol can be typed on an Apple Mac with the key sequence Alt+J (on certain keyboard layouts). ""alt-J"" were formerly known as both ""Daljit Dhaliwal"" and ""Films"", but were later forced to change to ""Alt-J"" because an American band called ""The Films"" already existed. 

Contributions:
The band produced the song ""Buffalo"" for the David O. Russell film Silver Linings Playbook, starring Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence. 
Several of their tracks, including ""Something Good"" and ""Fitzpleasure"", have been used for BBC 2's channel idents. ""Fitzpleasure"" was also featured at the end of the season 8 episode, ""Allosaurus Crush Castle"" of the television series Weeds. In mid-2013, Nokia used the track ""Fitzpleasure"" in their commercial for the Lumia 925 in Europe and Lumia 928 in the United States. ""Fitzpleasure"" was also used in the UK trailer for The Way, Way Back, and was featured in an episode of the television series ""Broad City"" Season 1 Episode 1. ""Tessellate"" was featured at the beginning of Sons of Anarchy Season 6 Episode 5. Their songs were used in multiple episodes of Scrotal Recall, with ""Breezeblocks"" and ""Left Hand Free"" in the second episode and ""Every Other Freckle"" in the third. 
In February 2013 the band announced they would be composing the soundtrack for Toby Jones' new film Leave To Remain. 
The song ""Something Good"" was used for the soundtrack of the 2015 video game Life Is Strange. 
The song ""Fitzpleasure"" is also used in a trailer for the upcoming 2015 video game ""Battleborn"". 

Awards:
In 2012, alt-J's debut album won the British Mercury Prize. alt-J were also nominated for three Brit Awards (British Breakthrough Act, British Album of the Year and British Group of the Year).An Awesome Wave was announced as BBC Radio 6 Music Album of the Year 2012. Three of the tracks from this album gained entry into the Australian 2012 Triple J Hottest 100, with ""Something Good"" at number 81, ""Tessellate"" at number 64, and ""Breezeblocks"" coming third overall. In 2013, An Awesome Wave won Album of the year at the Ivor Novello Awards. This Is All Yours received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Alternative Music Album at the 57th Grammy Awards, and for IMPALA's European Independent Album of the Year Award.

Pink Floyd is one of rock's most successful and influential acts, having sold over 200 million albums worldwide and with 74.5 million certified units in the United States, making them one of the best-selling artists of all time. Currently the band consists of David Gilmour (vocals, guitar) and Nick Mason (drums).  The band's classic lineup was Roger Waters (vocals, bass), David Gilmour (vocals, guitar), Rick Wright (organ, keyboards, vocals) and Nick Mason (drums). Gilmour was brought into the band in 1968 to replace the band's founder, singer, guitarist and songwriter Syd Barrett, who had become increasingly erratic and departed from the band a few months after Gilmour's addition. The band became known for their advancements in the genres of psychedelic rock and progressive rock music, philosophical lyrics, avant-garde compositions, sonic experimentation, innovative cover art and elaborate live shows.   Pink Floyd enjoyed modest success in the late-1960s as a psychedelic band led by Syd Barrett. Barrett's increasingly erratic behavior eventually caused his colleagues to replace him after The Piper at the Gates of Dawn with guitarist David Gilmour. The band went on to record several elaborate concept albums; achieving worldwide success with 1973's The Dark Side of the Moon (The second best-selling album of all time), 1975's Wish You Were Here, 1977's Animals, and 1979's The Wall, among the best-selling, most critically acclaimed, and enduringly popular albums in rock music history. In 1985, singer and bassist Roger Waters declared Pink Floyd defunct. However, the remaining members continued recording and touring under the name, eventually reaching a settlement with Waters giving them rights to the name and most of the songs.  Pink Floyd evolved from an earlier band, formed in 1964, which was at various times called Sigma 6, The Meggadeaths, The Screaming Abdabs, and The Abdabs. When this band split up, some members -- guitarists Bob Klose and Roger Waters, drummer Nick Mason, and wind instrument player Rick Wright -- formed a new band called Tea Set, and were joined shortly thereafter by guitarist Syd Barrett, who became the band's primary vocalist as well. When Tea Set found themselves on the same bill as another band with the same name, Barrett came up with an alternative name on the spur of the moment, choosing The Pink Floyd Sound (after two blues musicians, Pink Anderson and Floyd Council). For a time after this they oscillated between 'Tea Set' and 'The Pink Floyd Sound', with the latter name eventually winning out. The word Sound was dropped fairly quickly, but the definite article was still used occasionally for several years afterward, up to about the time of the More soundtrack. In the early days, the band covered rhythm and blues staples such as ""Louie, Louie"", but gained notoriety for psychedelic interpretations, with extended improvised sections and 'spaced out' solos.  The heavily jazz-oriented Klose left the band to become a photographer shortly before Pink Floyd started recording, leaving an otherwise stable lineup with Barrett on lead guitar, Waters on bass guitar, Mason on drums and Wright switching to keyboards. Barrett started writing his own songs, influenced by American and British psychedelic rock with his own brand of whimsical humor. Pink Floyd became a favorite in the underground movement, playing at such prominent venues as the UFO club, the Marquee Club and the Roundhouse. As their popularity increased, the band members formed Blackhill Enterprises in October 1966, a six-way business partnership with their managers, Peter Jenner and Andrew King, issuing the singles ""Arnold Layne"" in March 1967 and ""See Emily Play"" in June 1967. ""Arnold Layne"" reached number 20 in the UK Singles Chart, and ""See Emily Play"" reached number 6, granting the band its first TV appearance on Top of the Pops in July 1967.  Released in August 1967, the band's debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, is today considered to be a prime example of British psychedelic music, and was generally well-received by critics at the time, and it is now viewed as one of the better debut albums by many critics. The album's tracks, predominantly written by Barrett, showcase poetic lyrics and an eclectic mixture of music, from the avant-garde free-form piece ""Interstellar Overdrive"" to whimsical songs such as ""The Scarecrow"", inspired by the Fenlands, a rural region north of Cambridge (Barrett, Gilmour and Waters's home town). Lyrics were entirely surreal and often referred to folklore, such as ""The Gnome"". The music reflected newer technologies in electronics through its prominent use of stereo panning and electric keyboards. The album was a hit in the UK where it peaked at #6, but did not get much attention in North America, reaching #131 in the U.S. During this period, the band toured with The Jimi Hendrix Experience, which helped to increase its popularity.  As the band became more and more popular, the stresses of life on the road and a significant intake of psychedelic drugs took their toll on Barrett, whose mental health had been deteriorating for several months. While Barrett's behavior has often been attributed to his drug use, there are many who think that a pre-existing condition, possibly schizophrenia, was equally to blame. In January 1968, guitarist David Gilmour joined the band to carry out Syd's playing and singing duties. With Barrett's behavior becoming less and less predictable, and his almost constant use of LSD, he became very unstable, often staring into space while the rest of the band performed. During some performances, he would simply strum one chord for the duration of a concert, or simply begin detuning his guitar. The band's live shows became increasingly ramshackle until, eventually, the other band members simply stopped taking him to the concerts. It was originally hoped that Syd would write for the band with Gilmour performing live, similar to how The Beach Boys had done with Brian Wilson. However, due to Barrett's increasingly difficult compositions, such as ""Have You got it Yet?"", which changed melodies and chord progression with every take, eventually made the rest of the band give up on this arrangement. Once Barrett's departure was formalized in April 1968, producers Jenner and King decided to remain with him, and the six-way Blackhill partnership was dissolved. The band adopted Steve O'Rourke as manager, and he remained with Pink Floyd until his death in 2003.  Musically, this period was one of experimentation for the band. Gilmour, Waters and Wright each contributed material that had its own voice and sound, giving this material less consistency than the Barrett-dominated early years or the more polished, collaborative sound of later years. Waters mostly wrote low-key, jazzy melodies with dominant bass lines and complex, symbolic lyrics, Gilmour focused on guitar-driven blues jams, and Wright preferred melodic psychedelic keyboard-heavy numbers. Unlike Waters, Gilmour and Wright preferred tracks that had simple lyrics or that were purely instrumental. Some of the band's most experimental music is from this period, such as ""A Saucerful of Secrets"", consisting largely of feedback and atonal screeches and loops, ""Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving With a Pict"", which is a series of sped-up voice samples resembling rodents chattering that reaches its climax in an incomprehensible Scottish dialect monologue, and ""Careful With That Axe, Eugene"" (performed under different names during this period), a very Waters-driven song with a bass and keyboard-heavy jam culminating in crashing drums and Waters's primal screams.  Whilst Barrett had written the bulk of the first album, only one Barrett composition, the Piper outtake ""Jugband Blues"", appeared on the second Floyd album. A Saucerful of Secrets was released in June 1968, reaching #9 in the UK and becoming the only Pink Floyd album not to chart in the U.S. Somewhat uneven due to Barrett's departure, the album still contained much of his psychedelic sound combined with the more experimental music that would be fully showcased on Ummagumma. Hints of the epic, lengthy songs to come are in its centerpiece, the 12-minute title track, but the album was poorly received by critics at the time, although critics today tend to be kinder to the album in the context of their body of work. Future Floyd albums would expand upon the idea of long, sprawling compositions, offering more focused songwriting with each subsequent release.  Pink Floyd were then recruited by director Barbet Schroeder to produce a soundtrack for his film, More, which premiered in May 1969. The music was released as a Floyd album in its own right, Music from the Film More, in July 1969; the album achieved another #9 finish in the UK, and peaked at #153 in the U.S. The band would use this and future soundtrack recording sessions to produce work that may not have fit into the idea of what would appear on a proper Pink Floyd LP; many of the tracks on More (as fans usually call it) were acoustic folk songs, although critics tend to find the collection of the film's music patchy and uneven. Two of these songs, ""Green Is the Colour"" and ""Cymbaline"", became fixtures in the band's live sets for a time, as can be heard in the many available bootleg recordings from this period. The latter was also the first Pink Floyd song to deal with Roger Waters's cynical attitude toward the music industry explicitly. The rest of the album consisted of incidental music with a few heavier rock songs thrown in, such as ""The Nile Song"".  The next record, the double album Ummagumma, was a mix of live recordings and unchecked studio experimentation by the band members, with each member recording half a side of a vinyl record as a solo project (Mason's first wife makes an uncredited contribution as a flautist). Though the album was realized as solo outings and a live set, it was originally intended as a purely avant-garde mixture of sounds from ""found"" instruments. The subsequent difficulties in recording and lack of group organization led to the shelving of the project. The title is slang for sexual procreation, and reflects the attitude of the band at the time, as frustrations in the studio followed them throughout these sessions. Wildly experimental on the studio disc (except for Waters's pure folk ""Grantchester Meadows""), with atonal and jarring piano pieces (""Sysyphus""), meandering folk guitar (""The Narrow Way"") and large percussion solos, the live disc featured excellent performances of some of their most popular psychedelic-era compositions and caused critics to receive the album more positively than the previous two albums. With fans, the album was Pink Floyd's most popular release yet, hitting UK #5 and making the U.S. charts at #74.  1970's Atom Heart Mother, the band's first recording with an orchestra, was a collaboration with avant-garde composer Ron Geesin. One side of the album consisted of the title piece, a 23-minute long rock-orchestral suite. The second side featured one song from each of the band's then-current vocalists (Roger Waters's folk-rock ""If"", David Gilmour's bluesy ""Fat Old Sun"" and Rick Wright's psychedelic ""Summer '68""). Another lengthy piece, ""Alan's psychedelic breakfast"", was a sound collage of a man cooking and eating breakfast and his thoughts on the matter, linked with instrumentals. The use of incidental sound effects and voice samples would thereafter be an important part of the band's sound. While Atom Heart Mother was considered a huge step back for the band at the time and is still considered one of its most inaccessible albums, it had the best chart performance for the band so far, reaching #1 in the UK and #55 in the U.S., although it has since been described by Gilmour as ""a load of rubbish"" and Waters as suitable for ""throwing in the dustbin and never [being] listened to by anyone ever again."" The album was another transitional piece for the group, hinting at future musical territory such as ""Echoes"" in its ambitious title track. The popularity of the album allowed Pink Floyd to embark on its first full U.S. tour. Before releasing its next original album, the band released a compilation album, Relics, which contained several early singles and B-sides, along with one original song (Waters's jazzy ""Biding My Time"").  This is the period in which the Floyd shed their association with the ""psychedelic"" scene (and its association with Barrett) and became a distinctive band that are difficult to classify. The divergent styles of Gilmour, Waters and Wright (Mason's writing contributions to the group were minimal) were merged into a unique sound. This era contains what many consider to be two of the band's masterpiece albums, The Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here. The sound became polished and collaborative, with the philosophic lyrics and distinctive bass lines of Waters combining with the unique blues guitar style of Gilmour and Wright's light keyboard melodies. Gilmour was the dominant vocalist throughout this period, and female choirs and Dick Parry's saxophone contributions in the studio became a notable part of the band's style. The sometimes atonal and harsh sound exhibited in the band's earlier years gave way to a very smooth, mellow and soothing sound, and the band's epic, lengthy compositions reached their zenith with ""Echoes"" from Meddle (although ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond"" exceeded it in total length, it was split in two pieces as the opening and closing of Wish You Were Here). This period was not only the beginning but the end of the truly collaborative era of the band; after 1975 Waters's influence became more dominant musically as well as lyrically. Wright's last credited composition and last lead vocal on a studio album until 1994's The Division Bell were in this period, and Gilmour's writing credits sharply declined in frequency until Waters left the band in 1985. The last ties with Barrett were severed in musical, as well as literal, fashion with Wish You Were Here, whose epic tracks ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts I-V)""/""Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts VI-IX)"" were written both as a tribute and elegy to their friend.  The band's sound was considerably more focused on Meddle (1971), with the 23-minute epic ""Echoes"" taking up the second side of the LP. ""Echoes"" is a smooth progressive rock song with extended guitar and keyboard solos and a long segue in the middle consisting largely of synthesized whale song produced on guitar, along with samples of seagull cries, described by Waters as a ""sonic poem"". Meddle was considered by Nick Mason to be ""the first real Pink Floyd album. It introduced the idea of a theme that can be returned to."" The album had the sound and style of the succeeding breakthrough-era Pink Floyd albums but stripped away the orchestra that was prominent in Atom Heart Mother. Meddle also included the atmospheric ""One of These Days"", a concert favorite featuring Nick Mason's menacing one-line vocal (""One of these days, I'm going to cut you into little pieces""), distorted and bluesy slide guitar, and a melody that at one point segues into a throbbing synthetic pulse quoting the theme tune of the cult classic science fiction television show Doctor Who. The mellow feeling of the next three albums is very present on ""Fearless"", and this track displays a country influence, as does the prominent pedal steel guitar on ""A Pillow of Winds"". The latter track is one of the Floyd's very few acoustic love songs. Waters's role as lead songwriter began to take form, with his jazzy ""San Tropez"" brought to the band practically completed. Meddle was greeted both by critics and fans enthusiastically, and Pink Floyd were rewarded with a #3 album chart peak in the UK; it only reached #70 in U.S. charts, partly because Capitol Records had not provided it with enough publicity support. Today, Meddle remains one of their most well-regarded efforts.  Obscured by Clouds was released in 1972 as the soundtrack to the film La Vallee, another art house film by Barbet Schroeder. This was the band's first U.S. Top 50 album (where it hit #46), hitting at #6 in the UK. While Mason described the album years later as ""sensational"", it is less well-regarded by critics. The lyrics of ""Free Four"", the first Pink Floyd song to achieve significant airplay in the U.S., introduced Waters's ruminations on his father's death in World War II which would figure in subsequent albums. Two other songs on the album, ""Wots...uh, the Deal"" and ""Childhood's End"", also hint at themes used in later albums, the former focusing on loneliness and desperation which would come to full fruit in the Roger Waters-led era, and the latter hinting much at the next album, fixated on life, death and the passage of time. ""Childhood's End"", inspired by the Arthur C. Clarke book of the same name, was also Gilmour's last lyrical contribution for 15 years. The album was, to an extent, stylistically different from the preceding Meddle, with the songs generally being shorter, often taking a somewhat pastoral approach compared to the atmospheric use of sound effects and keyboard on sections of Meddle, and sometimes even running into folk rock, blues rock and piano-driven soft rock (""Burning Bridges"", ""The Gold It's in the..."" and ""Stay"" being the best respective examples for each).  The release of Pink Floyd's massively successful 1973 album, The Dark Side of the Moon, was a watershed moment in the band's popularity. Pink Floyd had stopped issuing singles after 1968's ""Point Me at the Sky"" and was never a hit-single-driven group, but The Dark Side of the Moon featured a U.S. Top 20 single (""Money""). The album became the band's first #1 on U.S. charts, a huge improvement over its previous recordings. The critically-acclaimed album stayed on the Billboard Top 200 for an unprecedented 741 weeks (including 591 consecutive weeks from 1976 to 1988), establishing a world record and making it one of the top-selling albums of all time. It also remained 301 weeks on UK charts, despite never rising higher than #2 there, and is highly praised by critics. Saxophone forms an important part of the album's sound, exposing the band's jazz influences, and female backing vocals play a key role in helping to diversify the album's texture. For example, straight rock songs such as ""Money"" and ""Time"" are placed on either side of mellow pedal steel guitar sounds (reminiscent of Meddle) in ""Breathe"" and female vocal-laden song ""The Great Gig in the Sky"" (with Clare Torry on lead vocal), while minimalist instrumental ""On the Run"" is performed almost entirely on a single synthesizer. Incidental sound effects and snippets of interviews feature alongside the music, many of them taped in the studio. The album's lyrics and sound attempt to describe the different pressures that everyday life places upon human beings. This concept (conceived by Waters in a band meeting around Mason's kitchen table) proved a powerful catalyst for the band and together they drew up a list of themes, several of which would be revisited by Waters on later albums, such as ""Us and Them""'s musings on violence and the futility of war, and the themes of insanity and neurosis discussed in ""Brain Damage"". The album's complicated and precise sound engineering by Alan Parsons set new standards for sound fidelity; this trait became a recognizable aspect of the band's sound and played a part in the lasting chart success of the album, as audiophiles constantly replaced their worn-out copies.  Seeking to capitalize on its newfound fame, the band also released a compilation album, A Nice Pair, which was a gatefold repackaging of The Piper at the Gates of Dawn and A Saucerful of Secrets. It was also during this period that director Adrian Maben released the first Pink Floyd concert film, Live at Pompeii. The original theatrical cut featured footage of the band performing in 1971 at an amphitheater in Pompeii with no audience present (only the film crew and stage staff). Fortuitously, Maben also happened to capture some interviews and behind-the-scenes glimpses of the band during recording sessions for Dark Side of the Moon at Abbey Road Studios, some of which were incorporated alongside other new footage between songs in later versions of Live at Pompeii.  Wish You Were Here, released in 1975, carries an abstract theme of absence: absence of any humanity within the music industry and, most poignantly, the absence of Syd Barrett. Well-known for its popular title track, the album includes the largely instrumental, nine-part song suite ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond"", a tribute to Barrett in which the lyrics deal explicitly with the aftermath of his breakdown. Many of the musical influences in the band's past were brought together -- atmospheric keyboards, blues guitar pieces, extended saxophone solos (by Dick Parry), jazz fusion workouts and aggressive slide guitar -- in the suite's different linked parts, culminating in a funeral dirge played with synthesized horn. The remaining tracks on the album, ""Welcome to the Machine"" and ""Have a Cigar"", harshly criticize the music industry; the latter is sung by British folk singer Roy Harper. It was the first Pink Floyd album to reach #1 on both the UK and the U.S. charts, and critics praise it just as enthusiastically as Dark Side of the Moon. In a famous anecdote, a heavyset man with a completely shaved head and eyebrows wandered into the studio while the band was recording ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond"". The band could not recognize him for some time, when suddenly one of them realized it was Syd Barrett. He was greeted enthusiastically by the band but subsequently slipped away during the impromptu party for David Gilmour's wedding (which was, coincidentally, also on that day). It was the last time any of the other band members saw him. Gilmour recently confirmed this story, although he could not recall which song they were working on when Syd showed up. Barrett's eyebrow-shaving tendencies would later be revisited in the movie Pink Floyd: The Wall.  During this era, Waters asserted more and more control over Pink Floyd's output. Wright's influence became largely inconsequential, and he was fired from the band during the recording of The Wall. Much of the music from this period is considered secondary to the lyrics, which explore Waters's feelings about his father's death in World War II and his increasingly cynical attitude towards political figures such as Margaret Thatcher and Mary Whitehouse. Although still finely nuanced, the music grew more guitar-based at the expense of keyboards and saxophone, both of which became (at best) part of the music's background texture along with the obligatory sound effects. A full orchestra (even larger than the brass ensemble from Atom Heart Mother) plays a significant role on The Wall and especially The Final Cut.  By January 1977, and the release of Animals (UK #2, U.S. #3), the band's music came under increasing criticism from some quarters in the new punk rock sphere as being too flabby and pretentious, having lost its way from the simplicity of early rock and roll. Animals was, however, considerably more basic-sounding than the previous albums, due to either the influence of the burgeoning punk-rock movement or the fact that the album was recorded at Pink Floyd's new (and somewhat incomplete) Britannia Row Studios. The album was also the first to not have a single songwriting credit for Rick Wright. Animals again contained lengthy songs tied to a theme, this time taken in part from George Orwell's Animal Farm, which used ""Pigs"", ""Dogs"" and ""Sheep"" as metaphors for members of contemporary society. Despite the prominence of guitar, keyboards and synthesizers still play an important role on Animals, but the saxophone and female vocal work that defined much of the previous two albums' sound is absent. The result is a more hard-rock effort overall, bookended by two parts of a quiet acoustic piece. Many critics did not respond well to the album, finding it ""tedious"" and ""bleak"", although some celebrated it for almost those very reasons. For the cover artwork, a giant inflatable pig was commissioned to float between the chimney towers of London's Battersea Power Station. However, the wind made the pig balloon difficult to control, and in the end it was necessary to matte a photo of the pig balloon onto the album cover. The pig nevertheless became one of the enduring symbols of Pink Floyd, and inflatable pigs were a staple of the band's live shows from then on.  1979's epic rock opera The Wall, conceived by Waters, dealt with the themes of loneliness and failed communication, which were expressed by the metaphor of a wall built between a rock artist and his audience. This album gave Pink Floyd renewed acclaim and another chart-topping single with ""Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)"". The Wall also included the future concert staples ""Comfortably Numb"" and ""Run Like Hell"", with the former in particular becoming a cornerstone of album-oriented rock and classic-rock radio playlists as well as one of the group's best-known songs. The album was co-produced by Bob Ezrin, a friend of Waters who shared songwriting credits on ""The Trial"" and from whom the band later temporarily distanced themselves after quarreling with him over several contentious issues. Even more than during the Animals sessions, Waters was asserting his artistic influence and leadership over the band, which prompted increased conflicts with the other members. The music had become distinctly more hard-rock, although the large orchestrations on some tracks recalled an earlier period, and there are a few quieter songs interspersed throughout (such as ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" and ""Nobody Home""). Wright's influence was completely minimized, and he was fired from the band during recording, only returning on a fixed wage for the live shows in support of the album. Ironically, Wright was the only member of Pink Floyd to make any money from The Wall concerts, the rest covering the extensive cost overruns of their most spectacular concerts yet.  Despite never hitting #1 in the UK (it reached #3), The Wall spent 15 weeks atop the U.S. charts during 1980. Critics praised it, and it has sold over 30 million copies worldwide. It is the third-best selling album of all time in the U.S and the best selling album by a single artist to be released during the 1970s. It has been certified 23x platinum by the RIAA, for sales of 11.5 million copies in U.S. alone. The huge commercial success of The Wall made Pink Floyd the only artists since the The Beatles to have the best selling albums of two years (1973 and 1980) in less than a decade.  A film entitled Pink Floyd: The Wall was released in 1982, incorporating essentially all of the music from the album. The film, written by Waters and directed by Alan Parker, starred The Boomtown Rats founder Bob Geldof and featured striking animation by noted British artist and cartoonist Gerald Scarfe. It grossed over $14 million at the North American box office. A song which first appeared in the movie, ""When the Tigers Broke Free"", was released as a single on a limited basis. This song was finally made widely available on the compilation album Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd and the re-release of The Final Cut. Also in the film is the song ""What Shall We Do Now?"", which was cut out of the original album due to the time constraints of vinyl records. The only song from the album not used was ""Hey You"", but a sequence was filmed using the song and it only exists as raw footage with poor visual quality but very good audio quality. It was released for the first time as a bonus with the extras section of the 1999 DVD release as a deleted scene.  1983 saw the release of The Final Cut, dedicated to Roger Waters's father, Eric Fletcher Waters. Even darker in tone than The Wall, this album re-examined many previous themes, while also addressing then-current events, including Waters's anger at Britain's participation in the Falklands War, the blame for which he laid squarely at the feet of political leaders (""The Fletcher Memorial Home""). It concludes with a cynical and frightening glimpse at the possibility of nuclear war (""Two Suns in the Sunset""). Michael Kamen and Andy Bown contributed keyboard work in lieu of Richard Wright's departure, which had not been formally announced before the album's release. Though technically a Pink Floyd album, the LP's front cover displayed no words, only the back cover reading: ""The Final Cut - A requiem for the post war dream by Roger Waters, performed by Pink Floyd: Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Nick Mason"". Roger Waters received the sole songwriting credit for the entire record, which became a prototype in sound and form for later Waters solo projects. Waters has since said that he offered to release the record as a solo album, but the rest of the band rejected this idea. However, in his book Inside Out, drummer Nick Mason says that no such discussions ever took place. Gilmour reportedly asked Waters to hold back the release of the album so that he could write enough material to contribute, but this request was refused. The music's tone is largely similar to The Wall's but somewhat quieter and softer, resembling songs like ""Nobody Home"" more than ""Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)"". It is also more repetitive, with certain leitmotifs cropping up continually. Only moderately successful with fans by Floyd's standards (UK #1, U.S. #6), but reasonably well-received by critics, the album yielded one minor radio hit, ""Not Now John"", the only hard rock song on the album (and the only one partially sung by Gilmour). The arguments between Waters and Gilmour at this stage are rumored to be so bad that they were supposedly never seen in the recording studio simultaneously, and Gilmour's co-producer credit was dropped from the album sleeve (though he received attendant royalties). There was no tour for the album, although parts of it were performed live by Waters on his subsequent solo jaunts.  After The Final Cut was released, the band members went their separate ways and spent time working on individual projects. Gilmour was the first to complete his solo album, releasing About Face in March 1984. Wright joined forces with Dave Harris of Fashion to form Zee, which released the experimental album Identity a month after Gilmour's project. In May 1984, Waters released The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, a concept album once proposed as a Pink Floyd project. A year after his band mates' projects, Mason released the album Profiles, a collaboration with Rick Fenn of 10cc which featured guest appearances by Gilmour and UFO keyboardist Danny Peyronel.  Waters announced in December of 1985 that he was departing Pink Floyd, describing the band as ""a spent force creatively"", but in 1986 Gilmour and Mason began recording a new Pink Floyd album. At the same time, Roger Waters was working on his second solo album, entitled Radio K.A.O.S.. A bitter legal dispute ensued with Waters claiming that the name ""Pink Floyd"" should have been put to rest, but Gilmour and Mason upheld their conviction that they had the legal right to continue as ""Pink Floyd."" The suit was eventually settled out of court.  After considering and rejecting many other titles, the new album was released as A Momentary Lapse of Reason (UK #3, U.S. #3). Without Waters, who had been the band's dominant songwriter for over a decade and a half, the band sought the help of outside writers. As Pink Floyd had never done this before (except for the orchestral contributions of Geesin and Ezrin), this move received much criticism. Ezrin, who had by now renewed his friendship with Gilmour, served as co-producer as well as being one of these writers. Rick Wright also returned, at first as a salaried employee during the final recording sessions, and then officially rejoining the band after the subsequent tour.  Gilmour later admitted that Mason had hardly played on the album. Because of Mason and Wright's limited contributions, some critics say that A Momentary Lapse of Reason should really be regarded as a Gilmour solo effort, in much the same way that The Final Cut might be regarded as a Waters album.  A year later, the band released a double live album and a concert video taken from its 1988 Long Island shows, entitled Delicate Sound of Thunder, and later recorded some instrumentals for a classic-car racing film La Carrera Panamericana, set in Mexico and featuring Gilmour and Mason as participating drivers. During the race Gilmour and manager Steve O'Rourke (acting as his map-reader) crashed. O'Rourke suffered a broken leg, but Gilmour walked away with just some bruises. The instrumentals are notable for including the first Floyd material co-written by Wright since 1975, as well as the only Floyd material co-written by Mason since Dark Side of the Moon.  1992 saw the box set release of Shine On. The 9 disc set included re-releases of the studio albums A Saucerful of Secrets, Meddle, Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, The Wall, and A Momentary Lapse of Reason. A bonus disc entitled The Pink Floyd Early Singles was also included. The set's packaging featured a case allowing the albums to stand vertically together, with the side-by-side spines displaying an image of the Dark Side of the Moon cover. The circular text of each CD includes the almost illegible words ""The Big Bong Theory"".  The band's next recording was the 1994 release The Division Bell, which was much more of a group effort than Momentary Lapse had been, with Wright now reinstated as a full and contributing band member and figuring prominently in the writing credits. The album was received more favorably by critics and fans alike than Lapse had been, but was still heavily criticized as tired and formulaic. It was the second Pink Floyd album to reach #1 on both the UK and U.S. charts. The Division Bell was another concept album, in some ways representing Gilmour's take on the same themes Waters had tackled with The Wall. The title was suggested to Gilmour by his friend Douglas Adams. Many of the lyrics were co-written by Polly Samson, Gilmour's girlfriend at the time, whom he married shortly after the album's release. Besides Samson, the album featured most of the musicians who had joined the A Momentary Lapse of Reason tour, as well as saxophonist Dick Parry, a contributor to the mid-70s Floyd albums. Anthony Moore, who had co-written the lyrics for several songs on the previous album, penned the lyrics for a tune by Wright, ""Wearing the Inside Out"", Wright's first lead vocal on a Pink Floyd record since Dark Side of The Moon. Wright and Moore's writing collaboration continued on nearly every song on Wright's subsequent solo album, Broken China.  At the end of the tour in support of The Division Bell in1994, Gilmour stopped planning new music and tours for Pink Floyd, and the band went inactive.  The band released a live album entitled P*U*L*S*E in 1995. It hit #1 in U.S. and featured songs recorded during The Division Bell tour, primarily from concerts in London's Earls Court. The Division Bell concerts featured a mix of classic and modern Pink Floyd. The Pulse album has an entire performance of Dark Side of the Moon. VHS and Laserdisc versions of the concert at London's Earls Court 20 October 1994, were also released. A DVD edition was released on 10 July 2006 and quickly topped the charts. The original edition's CD case had an LED, timer IC, and battery which caused a red flash to blink once per second, like a heartbeat.  In 1995, the band received their first and only Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance for ""Marooned"".  On 17 January 1996, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by The Smashing Pumpkins' frontman Billy Corgan. Roger Waters did not attend, still being antagonistic towards his former bandmates. At their acceptance speech, Gilmour - referring to the final verse of Dark Side of the Moon - said, ""I'll have to grab a couple more of these for our two band members that started playing different tunes; Roger and Syd..."". Although Mason was present to accept the award, he did not join Gilmour and Wright (and Billy Corgan) for their acoustic performance of 'Wish You Were Here'.  1996 saw the release of Richard Wright's second solo album, Broken China, where he collaborated again with lyricist Anthony Moore.  A live recording of The Wall was released in 2000, compiled from the 1980-1981 London concerts, entitled Is There Anybody Out There? The Wall Live 1980-81. It reached #19 on the American album chart. In 2001, a remastered two-disc set of the band's best-known tracks entitled Echoes was released. Gilmour, Mason, Waters and Wright all collaborated on the editing, sequencing, and song selection of the included tracks. Minor controversy was caused due to the songs seguing into one another non-chronologically, presenting the material out of the context of the original albums. Some of the tracks, such as ""Echoes"", ""Shine on You Crazy Diamond"", ""Marooned"", and ""High Hopes"" have had substantial sections removed from them. The album reached #2 on the UK and U.S. charts.  In 2003, an SACD reissue of Dark Side of the Moon was released with new artwork on the front cover. The album was also re-released as an 180 gram, virgin vinyl pressing in 2003, which included all the original album art from the original release of the album, albeit with a new poster. Nick Mason's book, Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd was published in 2004 in Europe and 2005 in the U.S. Long-time Pink Floyd manager Steve O'Rourke died on 30 October 2003. Gilmour, Mason and Wright reunited at his funeral and performed ""Fat Old Sun"" and ""The Great Gig in the Sky"" in Chichester Cathedral in tribute.  Two years later, on 2 July 2005, the band reunited for a one-off performance at the London Live 8 concert. This time, however, they were joined by Waters -- the first time all four band members were on stage together in 24 years. The band performed a four-song set consisting of ""Speak To Me/Breathe (Breathe In The Air)"", ""Money"", ""Wish You Were Here"", and ""Comfortably Numb"", with both Gilmour and Waters sharing lead vocals. At the end of their performance Gilmour said ""thank you very much, good night"" and started to walk off the stage. Waters called him back, however, and the band shared a group hug that became one of the most famous images of Live 8.  In the week after Live 8, there was a revival of interest in Pink Floyd. According to record store chain HMV, sales of Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd went up, in the following week, by 1343%, while Amazon.com reported increases in sales of The Wall at 3600%, Wish You Were Here at 2000%, The Dark Side of the Moon at 1400% and Animals at 1000%. David Gilmour subsequently declared that he would donate his share of profits from this sales boom to charity, and urged all the other artists and record companies profiting from Live 8 to do the same. On 16 November 2005 Pink Floyd were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame by Pete Townshend. Gilmour and Mason attended in person, explaining that Wright was in hospital following eye surgery, and Waters appeared on a video screen, from Rome.  David Gilmour released his third solo record, On an Island, on 6 March 2006, and began a tour of small concert venues in Europe, Canada and the U.S. with a band including Richard Wright and other musicians from the post-Waters Pink Floyd tours. Roger Waters was also invited to join the band (along with Nick Mason) in London, but final rehearsals for his 2006 Europe/U.S. tour required him to decline. Nonetheless, Gilmour, Wright, and Mason's encore performances of ""Wish You Were Here"" and ""Comfortably Numb"" marked the first performance by Pink Floyd since Live 8. Waters was joined on stage by Mason for a few performances of Dark Side of the Moon during his 2006 tour. Wright was also invited to join Waters for the first performance, but Wright refused on the grounds that he had to work on his solo album (which remains unreleased). Waters' worldwide The Dark Side of the Moon Live tour consisted of Dark Side of the Moon in its entirety along with a selection of other Pink Floyd material and a small number of songs from Waters' solo career, although no songs from The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking or Radio K.A.O.S. were included. Waters is reported to be working on a solo album, and there has been talk of him doing a Broadway musical version of The Wall, with other Pink Floyd music to be inserted.  Many fans expressed hope that the band's Live 8 appearance would lead to a reunion tour, and a record-breaking US$250 million deal for a world tour was offered, but the band made it clear that they had no such plans. In the weeks after the show, however, the rifts between the members seemed to have mostly healed. Gilmour confirmed that he and Waters are on ""pretty amicable terms"". Waters indicated that he would like to play together again not for a whole tour but for a single event, similar to Live 8.  On 31 January 2006, David Gilmour issued a joint statement on behalf of the group stating that they had no plans to reunite, refuting rumours from several media outlets. Gilmour later stated in an interview with La Repubblica that he is finished with Pink Floyd and wishes to focus on solo projects and his family. He mentions that he agreed to play Live 8 with Waters to support the cause, to make peace with Waters, and knowing he would regret not taking part. However, he states that Pink Floyd would be willing to perform for a concert ""that would support Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts"". Then speaking with Billboard, Gilmour changed his ""finished with Pink Floyd"" sentiment to ""who knows"".  2007 saw the 40th anniversary of Pink Floyd's signing to EMI and the 40th anniversary of the release of their first three singles ""Arnold Layne"", ""See Emily Play"" and ""Apples and Oranges"" and their debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. This was marked by the release of a limited edition set containing mono and stereo mixes of the albums, plus tracks from the singles and other rare recordings.  On 10 May 2007, Roger Waters performed at the Syd Barrett tribute concert at the Barbican Centre in London. This was then followed by a surprise performance by the post-Waters Pink Floyd line-up of David Gilmour, Richard Wright and Nick Mason of ""Arnold Layne"" to a rapturous applause and standing ovation. As it turned out, it would be the final time this configuration of Pink Floyd would ever perform together.  Hopes of a second reunion concert with the band's classic lineup were dashed when Waters did not perform with the group. Roger Waters took to the stage to screams of ""Pink Floyd!"" to which he responded, ""Later."" Gilmour, Mason, and Wright took to the stage for what would be the final time to screams of ""Roger Waters!"" to which Gilmour politely responded, ""Yeah, he was here too, now the rest of us.""  In a January 2007 interview, Waters suggested he had become more open to a Pink Floyd reunion: ""I would have no problem if the rest of them wanted to get together. It wouldn't even have to be to save the world. It could be just because it would be fun. And people would love it.""  On 25 September 2007, Gilmour stated that a future reunion of Pink Floyd in any form, be it with or without Roger Waters, looked grim, stating that ""I can't see why I would want to be going back to that old thing. It's very retrogressive. I want to look forward, and looking back isn't my joy.""  In December 2007, Pink Floyd released a new CD box set, Oh, By the Way, containing all fourteen studio albums with their newest respective CD remasters, original vinyl artwork plus new artwork from Storm Thorgerson. Mason and Waters had said that they would be happy to do a Pink Floyd tour, but during the BBC1 Special, ""Which One's Pink?,"" when asked about whether the band would reform, Gilmour ambiguously stated either ""Ain't gonna happen"" or ""Anything could happen"". Which of these two phrases were said is debatable. During the same documentary, Wright stated that he ""wouldn't mind playing the Pink Floyd 'music' again,"" but said nothing solid about reuniting with the actual members.  In a May 2008 interview for BBC 6Music, David Gilmour hinted that he would be in favour of another one-off show, but ruled out a full tour: ""Who knows? Who knows the future? I haven't absolutely said 'no' to the possibility but I think that in reality any sort of long-term thing together is not going to happen. We did the one-off thing and that was probably enough for me but we shall see. At my incredibly advantaged age -having achieved this- I've earned the right to sit on my ass for a little while and consider what to do next."" In 2008, Pink Floyd were awarded the Polar Music Prize for their contribution to contemporary music. Roger Waters and Nick Mason were present at the ceremony, where they received the prize from King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden.  Speaking to Associated Press to promote the release of his new live album, David Gilmour revealed that a reunion ""categorically"" won't happen. Gilmour said: ""The [Live 8] rehearsals were less enjoyable. The rehearsals convinced me it wasn't something I wanted to be doing a lot of. There have been all sorts of farewell moments in people's lives and careers which they have then rescinded, but I think I can fairly categorically say that there won't be a tour or an album again that I take part in. It isn't to do with animosity or anything like that. It's just that I've done that. I've been there, I've done it.""  On 15 September 2008, Richard Wright died at age 65. He was lauded by his surviving bandmates, Gilmour in particular, for his influence on the overall sound of Pink Floyd.  In April 2009, it was revealed that the band had initiated legal action against EMI, their label for over four decades, for allegedly failing to pay royalties. The dispute is reportedly connected to an ongoing disagreement with Terra Firma Capital Partners, the private equity firm who took ownership of EMI in 2007.  On 10 July 2010, Roger Waters and David Gilmour performed together at a charity event for the Hoping Foundation. The event took place at Kidlington in Oxfordshire, England. The pair played to an audience of approximately 200. The event raised money for Palestinian children in order to give them a better life. Gilmour played this event in 2009, when he performed alongside Kate Moss. In return for Waters' appearance at the event, Gilmour has agreed to perform ""Comfortably Numb"" at one of Waters' upcoming performances of The Wall.  On 12 October 2010, Gilmour released Metallic Spheres, a collaboration with techno group The Orb  In 2011, Roger Waters embarked on a tour of ""The Wall"". He confirmed that David Gilmour would perform guitar and vocals on ""Comfortably Numb"" at one of the performances. Gilmour appeared at the 12 May 2011 concert at the O2 Arena in London. Gilmour and Nick Mason joined Waters at the end of the show for a performance of ""Outside the Wall""  On 26 September 2011, Pink Floyd and EMI launched an exhaustive re-release campaign under the title Why Pink Floyd...?, reissuing the band's back catalogue in newly remastered versions, including special ""Immersion"" multi-disc multi-format editions. All the albums have been remastered by James Guthrie, the co-producer of The Wall.  On 7 July ]2014, the band announced they would be releasing their fifteenth studio album. ""The Endless River"". The record uses the 1994 ambient session known as ""The Big Spliff"" as its basis. The ""Big Spliff"" recording was expanded upon in recording sessions in 2013 and 2014. The record will feature material recorded by the late Rick Wright for the 1994 session, but will not include Roger Waters. ""The Endless River"" is slated to be released in October 2014.

Pink Floyd were founded in 1965 by students Syd Barrett, Nick Mason, Roger Waters, and Richard Wright. They gained popularity performing in London's underground music scene during the late 1960s, and under Barrett's leadership released two charting singles and a successful debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). David Gilmour joined as a fifth member in December 1967; Barrett left the band in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health exacerbated by drug use. Waters became the band's primary lyricist and, by the mid-1970s, their dominant songwriter, devising the concepts behind their critically and commercially successful albums The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977), The Wall (1979) and The Final Cut (1983). 
Wright left Pink Floyd in 1979, followed by Waters in 1985, declaring it a ""spent force"". Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd; Wright rejoined them as a session musician and, later, a band member. The three produced two more albums, A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987) and The Division Bell (1994), and toured until 1994. After nearly two decades of acrimony, Pink Floyd reunited with Waters in 2005 for a performance at the global awareness event Live 8, but Gilmour and Waters have since stated they have no plans to reunite as a band again. Barrett died in 2006 and Wright in 2008. The final Pink Floyd studio album, The Endless River, recorded without Waters and based on material recorded in 1993-1994, was released in November 2014. 
Pink Floyd were inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. By 2013, the band had sold more than 250 million records worldwide, including 75 million certified units in the United States. 

1963-67: early years:

Formation:
Roger Waters met drummer Nick Mason while they were both studying architecture at the London Polytechnic at Regent Street. They first played music together in a group formed by Keith Noble and Clive Metcalfe with Noble's sister Sheilagh. Keyboardist Richard Wright, a fellow architecture student, joined later that year, and the group became a sextet named Sigma 6, the first band to include Waters, who was at this time playing lead guitar; Wright, who at first played rhythm guitar since there was rarely an available keyboard; and Mason on drums. The band started performing during private functions, while rehearsing in a tearoom in the basement of the Regent Street Polytechnic. They performed songs by The Searchers and material written by their manager and songwriter, fellow student Ken Chapman. 
In September 1963, Waters and Mason moved into a flat at 39 Stanhope Gardens, near Crouch End London, owned by Mike Leonard, a part-time tutor at the nearby Hornsey College of Art and the Regent Street Polytechnic. Mason moved out after the 1964 academic year, and guitarist Bob Klose moved in during September 1964, prompting Waters' switch to bass. Sigma 6 went through a number of other transitory names, including the Meggadeaths, the Abdabs and the Screaming Abdabs, Leonard's Lodgers, and the Spectrum Five before settling on the Tea Set. In 1964, as Metcalfe and Noble left to form their own band, guitarist Syd Barrett joined Klose and Waters at Stanhope Gardens. Barrett, two years younger, had moved to London in 1962 to study at the Camberwell College of Art. Waters and Barrett were childhood friends; Waters had often visited Barrett and watched him play guitar at Barrett's mother's house. Mason said about Barrett: ""In a period when everyone was being cool in a very adolescent, self-conscious way, Syd was unfashionably outgoing; my enduring memory of our first encounter is the fact that he bothered to come up and introduce himself to me."" 
Noble and Metcalfe left the Tea Set in late 1963, and Klose introduced the band to singer Chris Dennis, a technician with the Royal Air Force (RAF). In December 1964, they managed to secure their first recording time, at a studio in West Hampstead, through one of Wright's friends, who let them use some down time for free. Wright, who was taking a break from his studies, did not participate in the session. When the RAF assigned Dennis a post in Bahrain in early 1965, Barrett became the band's frontman. Later that year, they became the resident band at the Countdown Club, near Kensington High Street in London, where from late night until early morning they played three sets of ninety minutes each. During this period, spurred by the group's need to extend their sets in order to minimise song repetition, came the band's ""realisation that songs could be extended with lengthy solos"", wrote Mason. After pressure from his parents and advice from his college tutors, Klose quit the band in mid-1965 and Barrett took over on lead guitar. The group first referred to themselves as the Pink Floyd Sound in late 1965. Barrett created the name on the spur of the moment when he discovered that another band, also called the Tea Set, were to perform at one of their gigs. The name is derived from the given names of two blues musicians whose Piedmont blues records Barrett had in his collection, Pink Anderson and Floyd Council. 
By 1966, the group's repertoire consisted mainly of rhythm and blues songs and they had begun to receive paid bookings, including one for a performance at the Marquee Club in March 1966, where Peter Jenner noticed them. A lecturer at the London School of Economics, Jenner was impressed by the sonic effects Barrett and Wright created, and with his business partner and friend Andrew King, he became their manager. The pair had little experience in the music industry and used King's inherited money to set up Blackhill Enterprises, purchasing about £1,000 worth of new instruments and equipment for the band. It was around this time that Jenner suggested they drop the ""Sound"" part of their band name, thus becoming the Pink Floyd. Under Jenner and King's guidance, the group became part of London's underground music scene, playing at venues including All Saints Hall and the Marquee. While performing at the Countdown Club, the band had experimented with long instrumental excursions, and they began to expand upon these with rudimentary but visually effective light shows, projected by coloured slides and domestic lights. Jenner and King's social connections helped gain the band prominent coverage in the Financial Times and an article in The Sunday Times which stated: ""At the launching of the new magazine IT the other night a pop group called the Pink Floyd played throbbing music while a series of bizarre coloured shapes flashed on a huge screen behind them ... apparently very psychedelic."" 
In 1966, they strengthened their business relationship with Blackhill Enterprises, becoming equal partners with Jenner and King and the band members each holding a one-sixth share. By late 1966, their set included fewer R&B standards and more Barrett originals, many of which would be included on their first album. While they had significantly increased the frequency of their performances, the band were not widely accepted at the time. Following a performance at a Catholic youth club, the owner refused to pay them, claiming that their performance wasn't music. When their management filed suit in a small claims court against the owner of the youth organisation, a local magistrate upheld the owner's decision. However, they were much better received at the UFO Club in London, where a small fan base began to build up around the band. Barrett's performances were enthusiastic, ""leaping around ... madness ... improvisation ... inspired to get past his limitations and into areas that were ... very interesting. Which none of the others could do"", wrote biographer Nicholas Schaffner. 

Signing with EMI:
In 1967, Pink Floyd began to attract the attention of the mainstream music industry. While in negotiations with record companies, IT co-founder and UFO club manager Joe Boyd and Pink Floyd's booking agent Bryan Morrison arranged for and funded the recording of some songs at Sound Techniques in West Hampstead. Included were the standout track ""Arnold Layne"" and ""Candy and a Currant Bun"" as its B-side, both of which they recorded on 29 January 1967. Three days later Pink Floyd signed with EMI, receiving a £5,000 advance. EMI released the band's first single, ""Arnold Layne"", on 10 March 1967, on its Columbia label. The song's references to cross-dressing led to a ban by several radio stations; however, some creative manipulation by the retailers who supplied sales figures to the music business meant that the single peaked in the UK at number 20. 
EMI-Columbia released Pink Floyd's second single, ""See Emily Play"", on 16 June 1967. It fared slightly better than ""Arnold Layne"", peaking at number 6 in the UK. They performed on the BBC's Look of the Week, where Waters and Barrett, erudite and engaging, faced tough questioning from Hans Keller. They appeared on the BBC's Top of the Pops, an immensely popular programme that controversially required artists to mime their singing and playing. Though Pink Floyd returned for two more performances, by the third, Barrett had begun to unravel, and it was around this time that the band first noticed significant changes in his behaviour. By early 1967, he was regularly using LSD, and Mason described him as ""completely distanced from everything going on"". 

The Piper at the Gates of Dawn:
Morrison and EMI producer Norman Smith negotiated Pink Floyd's first recording contract, and as part of the deal, the band agreed to record their first album at EMI Studios in London. Mason recalled that the sessions were trouble-free. Smith disagreed, stating that Barrett was unresponsive to his suggestions and constructive criticism. EMI-Columbia released The Piper at the Gates of Dawn in August 1967. The album peaked at number 6, spending 14 weeks on the UK charts. Pink Floyd continued to draw large crowds at the UFO Club; however, Barrett's mental breakdown was by then causing serious concern. The group initially hoped that his erratic behaviour would be a passing phase, but some were less optimistic, including Jenner and his assistant, June Child, who commented: ""I found Barrett in the dressing room and he was so ... gone. Roger Waters and I got him on his feet, and we got him out to the stage ... The band started to play and Syd just stood there. He had his guitar around his neck and his arms just hanging down."" 
Forced to cancel Pink Floyd's appearance at the prestigious National Jazz and Blues Festival, as well as several other shows, King informed the music press that Barrett was suffering from nervous exhaustion. Waters arranged a meeting with psychiatrist R. D. Laing, and though Waters personally drove Barrett to the appointment, Barrett refused to come out of the car. A stay in Formentera with Sam Hutt, a doctor well established in the underground music scene, led to no visible improvement. The band followed a few concert dates in Europe during September with their first tour of the US in October. As the US tour went on, Barrett's condition grew steadily worse. During appearances on the Dick Clark and Pat Boone shows in November, Barrett confounded his hosts by not responding to questions and staring off into space. He refused to move his lips when it came time to mime ""See Emily Play"" on Boone's show. After these embarrassing episodes, King ended their US visit and immediately sent them home to London. Soon after their return, they supported Jimi Hendrix during a tour of England; however, Barrett's depression worsened as the tour continued, reaching a crisis point in December, when the band responded by adding a new member to their lineup. 

1968-77: transition and international success:

Gilmour replaces Barrett:
In December 1967, the group added guitarist David Gilmour as the fifth member of Pink Floyd. Gilmour already knew Barrett, having studied with him at Cambridge Tech in the early 1960s. The two had performed at lunchtimes together with guitars and harmonicas, and later hitch-hiked and busked their way around the south of France. In 1965, while a member of Joker's Wild, Gilmour had watched the Tea Set. Morrison's assistant, Steve O'Rourke, set Gilmour up in a room at O'Rourke's house with a salary of £30 per week, and in January 1968, Blackhill Enterprises announced Gilmour as the band's newest member; the second guitarist and its fifth member, the band intending to continue with Barrett as a nonperforming songwriter. Jenner commented: ""The idea was that Dave would ... cover for Barrett's eccentricities and when that got to be not workable, Syd was just going to write. Just to try to keep him involved"". In an expression of his frustration, Barrett, who was expected to write additional hit singles to follow up ""Arnold Layne"" and ""See Emily Play"", instead played the band's ""Have You Got It Yet?"", intentionally changing the structure on each performance so as to make the song impossible to follow and learn. In a January 1968 photo-shoot of the five-man Pink Floyd, the photographs show Barrett looking detached from the others, staring into the distance. 
Working with Barrett eventually proved too difficult, and matters came to a head in January while en route to a performance in Southampton when a band member asked if they should collect Barrett. According to Gilmour, the answer was ""Nah, let's not bother"", signalling the end of Barrett's tenure with Pink Floyd. Waters later admitted, ""He was our friend, but most of the time we now wanted to strangle him"". In early March 1968, Pink Floyd met with business partners Jenner and King to discuss the band's future; Barrett agreed to leave. 
Jenner and King believed Barrett to be the creative genius of the band, and decided to represent him and end their relationship with Pink Floyd. Morrison then sold his business to NEMS Enterprises, and O'Rourke became the band's personal manager. Blackhill announced Barrett's departure on 6 April 1968. After Barrett's departure, the burden of lyrical composition and creative direction fell mostly on Waters. Initially, Gilmour mimed to Barrett's voice on the group's European TV appearances; however, while playing on the university circuit, they avoided Barrett songs in favour of Waters and Wright material such as ""It Would Be So Nice"" and ""Careful with That Axe, Eugene"". 

A Saucerful of Secrets:

In 1968, Pink Floyd returned to Abbey Road Studios to record their second album, A Saucerful of Secrets. The LP included Barrett's final contribution to their discography, ""Jugband Blues"". Waters began to develop his own songwriting, contributing ""Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun"", ""Let There Be More Light"" and ""Corporal Clegg"". Wright composed ""See-Saw"" and ""Remember a Day"". Smith encouraged them to self-produce their music, and they recorded demos of new material at their houses. With Smith's instruction at Abbey Road, they learned how to use the recording studio to realise their artistic vision. However, Smith remained unconvinced by their music, and when Mason struggled to perform his drum part on ""Remember a Day"", Smith stepped in as his replacement. Wright recalled Smith's attitude about the sessions, ""Norman gave up on the second album ... he was forever saying things like, 'You can't do twenty minutes of this ridiculous noise.'"" As neither Waters nor Mason could read music, to illustrate the structure of the album's title track, they invented their own system of notation. Gilmour later described their method as looking ""like an architectural diagram"". 
Released in June 1968, the album featured a psychedelic cover designed by Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis. The first of several Pink Floyd album covers designed by Hipgnosis, it was the second time that EMI permitted one of their groups to contract designers for an album jacket. The release peaked at number 9, spending 11 weeks on the UK chart.Record Mirror gave the album an overall favourable review, but urged listeners to ""forget it as background music to a party"".John Peel described a live performance of the title track as ""like a religious experience"", while NME described the song as ""long and boring ... with little to warrant its monotonous direction"". On the day after the album's UK release, Pink Floyd performed at the first ever free concert in Hyde Park. In July 1968, they returned to the US for a second visit. Accompanied by the Soft Machine and the Who, it marked Pink Floyd's first significant tour. In December of that year, they released ""Point Me at the Sky""; no more successful than the two singles they had released since ""See Emily Play"", it would be the band's last until their 1973 release, ""Money"". 

Ummagumma, Atom Heart Mother, and Meddle:

Ummagumma represented a departure from their previous work. Released as a double-LP on EMI's Harvest label, the first two sides contained live performances recorded at Manchester College of Commerce and Mothers, a club in Birmingham. The second LP contained a single experimental contribution from each band member.Ummagumma received positive reviews upon its release, in November 1969. The album peaked at number 5, spending 21 weeks on the UK chart. 
In October 1970, Pink Floyd released Atom Heart Mother. An early version premièred in France in January, but disagreements over the mix prompted the hiring of Ron Geesin to work out the sound issues. Geesin worked to improve the score, but with little creative input from the band, production was troublesome. Geesin eventually completed the project with the aid of John Alldis, who was the director of the choir hired to perform on the record. Smith earned an executive producer credit, and the album marked his final official contribution to the band's discography. Gilmour said it was ""A neat way of saying that he didn't ... do anything"". Waters was critical of Atom Heart Mother, claiming that he would prefer if it were ""thrown into the dustbin and never listened to by anyone ever again."" Gilmour was equally dismissive of the album and once described it as ""a load of rubbish"", stating: ""I think we were scraping the barrel a bit at that period."" Pink Floyd's first number 1 album, Atom Heart Mother was hugely successful in Britain, spending 18 weeks on the UK chart. It premièred at the Bath Festival on 27 June 1970. 
Pink Floyd toured extensively across America and Europe in 1970. In 1971, Pink Floyd took second place in a reader's poll, in Melody Maker, and for the first time were making a profit. Mason and Wright became fathers and bought homes in London while Gilmour, still single, moved to a 19th-century farm in Essex. Waters installed a home recording studio at his house in Islington in a converted toolshed at the back of his garden. 

In January 1971, upon their return from touring Atom Heart Mother, Pink Floyd began working on new material. Lacking a central theme, they attempted several unproductive experiments; engineer John Leckie described the sessions as often beginning in the afternoon and ending early the next morning, ""during which time nothing would get accomplished. There was no record company contact whatsoever, except when their label manager would show up now and again with a couple of bottles of wine and a couple of joints."" The band spent long periods working on basic sounds, or a guitar riff. They also spent several days at Air Studios, attempting to create music using a variety of household objects, a project which would be revisited between The Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here. 
Released in October 1971, ""Meddle not only confirms lead guitarist David Gilmour's emergence as a real shaping force with the group, it states forcefully and accurately that the group is well into the growth track again"" wrote Jean-Charles Costa of Rolling Stone.NME called Meddle ""an exceptionally good album"", singling out ""Echoes"" as the ""Zenith which the Floyd have been striving for."" However, Melody Maker's Michael Watts found it underwhelming, calling the album ""a soundtrack to a non-existent movie"", and shrugging off Pink Floyd as ""so much sound and fury, signifying nothing.""Meddle is a transitional album between the Barrett-influenced group of the late 1960s and the emerging Pink Floyd. The LP peaked at number 3, spending 82 weeks on the UK chart. 

The Dark Side of the Moon:

Pink Floyd recorded The Dark Side of the Moon between May 1972 and January 1973, with EMI staff engineer Alan Parsons at Abbey Road. The title is an allusion to lunacy rather than astronomy. The band had composed and refined the material on Dark Side while touring the UK, Japan, North America and Europe. Producer Chris Thomas assisted Parsons. Hipgnosis designed the album's packaging, which included George Hardie's iconic refracting prism design on the cover. Thorgerson's Dark Side album cover features a beam of white light, representing unity, passing through a prism, which represents society. The resulting refracted beam of coloured light symbolises unity diffracted, leaving an absence of unity. Waters is the sole author of the album's lyrics. 
Released in March 1973, the LP became an instant chart success in the UK and throughout Western Europe, earning an enthusiastic response from critics. Each member of Pink Floyd except Wright boycotted the press release of The Dark Side of the Moon because a quadraphonic mix had not yet been completed, and they felt presenting the album through a poor-quality stereo PA system was insufficient.Melody Maker‍ '​s Roy Hollingworth described side one as ""utterly confused ... and difficult to follow"", but praised side two, writing: ""The songs, the sounds ... and the rhythms were solid ... the saxophone hit the air, the band rocked and rolled"".Rolling Stone‍ '​s Loyd Grossman described it as ""a fine album with a textural and conceptual richness that not only invites, but demands involvement."" 

Throughout March 1973, The Dark Side of the Moon featured as part of Pink Floyd's US tour. The album is one of the most commercially successful rock albums of all time; a US number 1, it remained on the Billboard chart for more than fourteen years, selling more than 40 million copies worldwide. In Britain, the album peaked at number 2, spending 364 weeks on the UK chart.Dark Side is the world's second best-selling album, and the twenty-first best-selling album of all time in the US. The success of the album brought enormous wealth to the members of Pink Floyd. Waters and Wright bought large country houses while Mason became a collector of expensive cars. Disenchanted with their US record company, Capitol Records, Pink Floyd and O'Rourke negotiated a new contract with Columbia Records, who gave them a reported advance of $1,000,000, which is worth approximately $5,000,000 today. In Europe, they continued to be represented by Harvest Records. 

Wish You Were Here:

After a tour of the UK performing Dark Side, Pink Floyd returned to the studio in January 1975 and began work on their ninth studio album, Wish You Were Here. Parsons declined an offer to continue working with them, becoming successful in his own right with the Alan Parsons Project, and so the band turned to Brian Humphries. Initially, they found it difficult to compose new material; the success of The Dark Side of the Moon had left Pink Floyd physically and emotionally drained. Wright later described these early sessions as ""falling within a difficult period"" and Waters found them ""torturous"". Gilmour was more interested in improving the band's existing material. Mason's failing marriage left him in a general malaise and with a sense of apathy, both of which interfered with his drumming. 
Despite the lack of creative direction, Waters began to visualise a new concept after several weeks. During 1974, Pink Floyd had sketched out three original compositions and had performed them at a series of concerts in Europe. These compositions became the starting point for a new album whose opening four-note guitar phrase, composed purely by chance by Gilmour, reminded Waters of Barrett. The songs provided a fitting summary of the rise and fall of their former bandmate. Waters commented: ""Because I wanted to get as close as possible to what I felt ... that indefinable, inevitable melancholy about the disappearance of Syd."" 
While Pink Floyd were working on the album, Barrett made an impromptu visit to the studio, during which Thorgerson recalled that he ""sat round and talked for a bit, but he wasn't really there."" He had changed significantly in appearance, so much so that the band did not initially recognise him. Waters was reportedly deeply upset by the experience. Most of Wish You Were Here premiered on 5 July 1975, at an open-air music festival at Knebworth. Released in September, it reached number one in both the UK and the US. 

Animals:

In 1975, Pink Floyd bought a three-storey group of church halls at 35 Britannia Row in Islington, and began converting the building into a recording studio and storage space. In 1976, they recorded their tenth album, Animals, in their newly finished 24-track studio. The concept of Animals originated with Waters, loosely based on George Orwell's political fable, Animal Farm. The album's lyrics described different classes of society as dogs, pigs, and sheep. Hipgnosis received credit for the packaging of Animals; however, Waters designed the final concept, choosing an image of the ageing Battersea Power Station, over which they superimposed an image of a pig. 
The division of royalties was a source of conflict between band members, who earned royalties on a per-song basis. Although Gilmour was largely responsible for ""Dogs"", which took up almost the entire first side of the album, he received less than Waters, who contributed the much shorter two-part ""Pigs on the Wing"". Wright commented: ""It was partly my fault because I didn't push my material ... but Dave did have something to offer, and only managed to get a couple of things on there."" Mason recalled: ""Roger was in full flow with the ideas, but he was really keeping Dave down, and frustrating him deliberately."" Gilmour, distracted by the birth of his first child, contributed little else toward the album. Similarly, neither Mason nor Wright contributed much toward Animals; Wright had marital problems, and his relationship with Waters was also suffering.Animals is the first Pink Floyd album that does not include a writing credit for Wright, who commented: ""Animals... wasn't a fun record to make ... this was when Roger really started to believe that he was the sole writer for the band ... that it was only because of him that we were still going ... when he started to develop his ego trips, the person he would have his conflicts with would be me."" 
Released in January 1977, the album peaked on the UK chart at number two, and the US chart at number three.NME described the album as ""one of the most extreme, relentless, harrowing and downright iconoclastic hunks of music"", and Melody Maker‍ '​s Karl Dallas called it ""an uncomfortable taste of reality in a medium that has become in recent years, increasingly soporific"". 
They performed much of the album's material during their ""In the Flesh"" tour, Pink Floyd's first experience playing large stadiums, the size of which caused unease in the band. Waters began arriving at each venue alone, departing immediately after the performance. On one occasion, Wright flew back to England, threatening to leave the band. At the Montreal Olympic Stadium, a group of noisy and enthusiastic fans in the front row of the audience irritated Waters so much that he spat at one of them. The end of the tour marked a low point for Gilmour, who felt that the band achieved the success they had sought, with nothing left for them to accomplish. 

1978-85: Waters-led era:

The Wall:
In July 1978, amid a financial turmoil caused by negligent investments, Waters presented the group with two original ideas for their next album. The first was a 90-minute demo with the working title Bricks in the Wall, and the other would later become Waters' first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Although both Mason and Gilmour were initially cautious, they chose the former to be their next album.Bob Ezrin co-produced, and he wrote a forty-page script for the new album. Ezrin based the story on the central figure of Pink--a gestalt character inspired by Waters' childhood experiences, the most notable of which was the death of his father in World War II. This first metaphorical brick led to more problems; Pink would become drug-addled and depressed by the music industry, eventually transforming into a megalomaniac, a development inspired partly by the decline of Syd Barrett. At the end of the album, the increasingly fascist audience would watch as Pink tore down the wall, once again becoming a regular and caring person. 
During the recording of The Wall, Waters, Gilmour and Mason became increasingly dissatisfied with Wright's lack of contribution to the album. Gilmour said that Wright ""hadn't contributed anything of any value whatsoever to the album--he did very, very little"" and that is why he ""got the boot"". According to Mason, ""Rick's contribution was to turn up and sit in on the sessions without doing anything, just 'being a producer'."" Waters commented: ""Wright was not prepared to cooperate in making the record ... and it was agreed by everybody ... either he can have a long battle or he can agree to ... finish making the album, keep his full share ... but at the end of it he would leave quietly. Rick agreed."" 
Although Pink Floyd had not released a single since 1973's ""Money"", ""Another Brick in the Wall (Part II)"" supported the album, topping the charts in the US and the UK. Released on 30 November 1979, The Wall topped the Billboard chart in the US for fifteen weeks, reaching number three in the UK.The Wall ranks number three on the RIAA's list of the all-time Top 100 albums, with 23 million certified units sold in the US. The cover is one of their most minimalist designs, with a stark white brick wall, and no trademark or band name. It was also their first album cover since The Piper at the Gates of Dawn not designed by Hipgnosis. 
Gerald Scarfe produced a series of animations for the subsequent live shows, The Wall Tour. He also commissioned the construction of large inflatable puppets representing characters from the storyline including the ""Mother"", the ""Ex-wife"" and the ""Schoolmaster"". Pink Floyd used the puppets during their performances of the album. Relationships within the band were at an all-time low; their four Winnebagos parked in a circle, the doors facing away from the centre. Waters used his own vehicle to arrive at the venue and stayed in different hotels from the rest of the band. Wright returned as a paid musician and was the only one of the four to profit from the venture, which lost about $600,000. 
The Wall concept also spawned a film, the original idea for which was to be a combination of live concert footage and animated scenes. However, the concert footage proved impractical to film. Alan Parker agreed to direct and took a different approach. The animated sequences would remain, but scenes would be acted by professional actors with no dialogue. Waters was screen-tested, but quickly discarded and they asked Bob Geldof to accept the role of Pink. Geldof was initially dismissive, condemning The Wall‍ '​s storyline as ""bollocks"". Eventually won over by the prospect of participation in a significant film and receiving a large payment for his work, Geldof agreed. Screened at the Cannes Film Festival in May 1982, Pink Floyd - The Wall premièred in the UK in July 1982. 

The Final Cut:
In 1982, Waters suggested a new musical project for the band, with the working title Spare Bricks, originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd - The Wall; however, with the onset of the Falklands War, Waters changed artistic direction and began writing new material. Waters saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and he dedicated the new album to his late father. Immediately there were arguments between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycling a number of songs passed over for The Wall. Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire.Michael Kamen, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then absent Wright. The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions. 
Though Mason's musical contributions were minimal, he stayed busy recording sound effects for an experimental Holophonic system to be used on the album. With marital problems of his own, he remained a distant figure. Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design, Waters choosing to design the cover himself. Released in March 1983, The Final Cut went straight to number one in the UK and number six in the US. Waters wrote all the lyrics, as well as all the music on the album. Gilmour did not have any material ready for the album and asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused. Gilmour later commented, ""I'm certainly guilty at times of being lazy ... but he wasn't right about wanting to put some duff tracks on The Final Cut.""Rolling Stone magazine gave the album five stars, with Kurt Loder calling it ""a superlative achievement ... art rock's crowning masterpiece"". Loder viewed The Final Cut as ""essentially a Roger Waters solo album"". 

""A spent force"" and Waters' departure:
Gilmour had recorded his second solo album, About Face, in 1984, and he used it to express his feelings about a variety of topics; from the murder of John Lennon to his relationship with Waters. He later stated that he used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd. Soon afterwards, Waters began touring his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded Identity, which went almost unnoticed upon its release. Mason released his second solo album, Profiles, in August 1985. 
Following the release of The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, Waters publicly insisted that Pink Floyd would not reunite. He contacted O'Rourke to discuss settling future royalty payments. O'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, and this angered Waters, who wanted to dismiss him as the band's manager. Waters terminated his management contract with O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs. Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia announcing he had left the band, and asked them to release him from his contractual obligations. Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd. Waters later stated that, by not making new albums, Pink Floyd would be in breach of contract--which would suggest that royalty payments would be suspended--and that the other band members had forced him from the group by threatening to sue him. Waters then went to the High Court in an effort to dissolve the band and prevent the use of the Pink Floyd name, declaring Pink Floyd ""a spent force creatively."" When his lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed, Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to obtain a veto over further use of the band's name. Gilmour responded by issuing a carefully worded press release affirming that Pink Floyd would continue to exist. He later told The Sunday Times: ""Roger is a dog in the manger and I'm going to fight him"". 

1986-95: Gilmour-led era:

A Momentary Lapse of Reason:

In 1987, Gilmour began recruiting musicians for what would become Pink Floyd's first album without Waters, A Momentary Lapse of Reason. There were legal obstacles to Wright's readmittance to the band; however, after a meeting in Hampstead Pink Floyd invited Wright to participate in the coming sessions. Gilmour later stated that Wright's presence, ""would make us stronger legally and musically""; Pink Floyd employed him as a paid musician with weekly earnings of $11,000. Recording sessions for the album began on Gilmour's houseboat, the Astoria, moored along the River Thames. Gilmour worked with several songwriters, including Eric Stewart and Roger McGough, eventually choosing Anthony Moore to write the album's lyrics. Gilmour would later admit that the project was difficult without Waters' creative direction. Mason, concerned that he was too out of practice to perform on the album, made use of session musicians to complete many of the drum parts. He instead busied himself with the album's sound effects. 
The album was released in September 1987. Storm Thorgerson, whose creative input was absent from The Wall and The Final Cut, designed the album cover. In order to drive home the point that Waters had left the band, they included a group photograph on the inside cover, the first since Meddle. The album went straight to number three in the UK and the US. Waters commented: ""I think it's facile, but a quite clever forgery ... The songs are poor in general ... and Gilmour's lyrics are third-rate."" Although Gilmour initially viewed the album as a return to the band's top form, Wright disagreed, stating: ""Roger's criticisms are fair. It's not a band album at all.""Q Magazine described the album as essentially a Gilmour solo effort. 
Waters attempted to subvert the Momentary Lack of Reason tour by contacting promoters in the US and threatening to sue them if they used the Pink Floyd name. Gilmour and Mason funded the start-up costs with Mason using his Ferrari 250 GTO as collateral. Early rehearsals for the upcoming tour were chaotic, with Mason and Wright entirely out of practice. Realising he had taken on too much work, Gilmour asked Bob Ezrin to assist them. As Pink Floyd toured throughout North America, Waters' Radio K.A.O.S. tour was on occasion, close by, though in much smaller venues than those hosting his former band's performances. Waters issued a writ for copyright fees for the band's use of the flying pig. Pink Floyd responded by attaching a large set of male genitalia to its underside to distinguish it from Waters' design. The parties reached a legal agreement on 23 December; Mason and Gilmour retained the right to use the Pink Floyd name in perpetuity and Waters received exclusive rights to, among other things, The Wall. 

The Division Bell:

For several years Pink Floyd had busied themselves with personal pursuits, such as filming and competing in the La Carrera Panamericana and recording a soundtrack for a film based on the event. In January 1993, they began working on a new album, returning to Britannia Row Studios, where for several days, Gilmour, Mason and Wright worked collaboratively, ad-libbing material. After about two weeks, the band had enough ideas to begin creating songs. Ezrin returned to co-produce the album and production moved to the Astoria, where from February to May 1993, they worked on about twenty-five ideas. 
Contractually, Wright was not a member of the band; he commented: ""It came close to a point where I wasn't going to do the album"". However, he earned five co-writing credits on the album, his first on a Pink Floyd album since 1975's Wish You Were Here. Another songwriter credited on the album was Gilmour's future wife, Polly Samson. She helped him write several tracks, including, ""High Hopes"", a collaborative arrangement which, though initially tense, ""pulled the whole album together"" commented Ezrin. They hired Michael Kamen to arrange the album's orchestral parts; Dick Parry and Chris Thomas also returned. Writer Douglas Adams provided the album title and Thorgerson the cover artwork. Thorgerson drew inspiration for the album cover from the Moai monoliths of Easter Island; two opposing faces forming an implied third face about which he commented: ""the absent face--the ghost of Pink Floyd's past, Syd and Roger"". Eager to avoid competing against other album releases, as had happened with A Momentary Lapse, Pink Floyd set a deadline of April 1994, at which point they would resume touring. The album reached number 1 in both the UK and the US. It spent 51 weeks on the UK chart. 
Pink Floyd spent more than two weeks rehearsing in a hangar at Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino, California, before opening on 29 March 1994, in Miami, with an almost identical road crew to that used for their Momentary Lapse of Reason tour. They played a variety of Pink Floyd favourites, and later changed their setlist to include The Dark Side of the Moon in its entirety. The tour ended on 29 October 1994, with the final performance of the last Pink Floyd tour so far. 

2005-present: reunion, deaths and final album:

Live 8 reunion:
See also: Live 8

On 2 July 2005, Waters, Gilmour, Mason and Wright performed together as Pink Floyd for the first time in more than 24 years, at the Live 8 concert in London's Hyde Park. Organiser Bob Geldof arranged the reunion, having called Mason earlier in the year to explore the possibility of their reuniting for the event. Geldof asked Gilmour, who turned down the offer, and then asked Mason to intercede on his behalf. Mason declined, but contacted Waters who was immediately enthusiastic. Waters then called Geldof to discuss the event, scheduled to take place in one month. About two weeks later Waters called Gilmour, their first conversation in two years, and the next day the latter agreed. Gilmour then contacted Wright who immediately agreed. In their statement to the press, they stressed the unimportance of the band's problems in the context of the Live 8 event. 
They planned their setlist at the Connaught Hotel in London, followed by three days of rehearsals at Black Island Studios. The sessions were problematic, with minor disagreements over the style and pace of the songs they were practising; the running order decided on the eve of the event. At the beginning of their performance, Waters told the audience: ""It is quite emotional, standing up here with these three guys after all these years, standing to be counted with the rest of you ... we're doing this for everyone who's not here, and particularly of course for Syd."" At the end, Gilmour thanked the audience and started to walk off the stage. Waters then called him back, and the band shared a group hug. Images of that hug were a favourite among Sunday newspapers after Live 8. Waters commented on their almost twenty years of animosity: ""I don't think any of us came out of the years from 1985 with any credit ... It was a bad, negative time, and I regret my part in that negativity."" 
Though Pink Floyd turned down a contract worth £136 million for a final tour, Waters did not rule out more performances, suggesting it ought to be for a charity event only. However, Gilmour told the Associated Press that a reunion would not happen, stating: ""The Live 8 rehearsals convinced me that it wasn't something I wanted to be doing a lot of ... There have been all sorts of farewell moments in people's lives and careers which they have then rescinded, but I think I can fairly categorically say that there won't be a tour or an album again that I take part in. It isn't to do with animosity or anything like that. It's just ... I've been there, I've done it."" In February 2006, Gilmour was interviewed by Gino Castaldo from the Italian newspaper La Repubblica; the resulting article declared: ""Patience for fans in mourning. The news is official. Pink Floyd the brand is dissolved, finished, definitely deceased."" When asked about the future of Pink Floyd, Gilmour responded: ""The band? It's over ... I've had enough. I'm 60 years old ... and it is much more comfortable to work on my own."" Since then, both Gilmour and Waters have repeatedly insisted that they have no plans to reunite with the surviving former members. 

Deaths of Barrett and Wright:
Barrett died on 7 July 2006, at his home in Cambridge, aged 60. His family interred him at Cambridge Crematorium on 18 July 2006; no Pink Floyd members attended. After Barrett's death, Wright commented: ""The band are very naturally upset and sad to hear of Syd Barrett's death. Syd was the guiding light of the early band line-up and leaves a legacy which continues to inspire."" Although Barrett had faded into obscurity over the previous 35 years, the national press praised him for his contributions to music. On 10 May 2007, Waters, Gilmour, Wright and Mason performed during a Barrett tribute concert at the Barbican Centre in London. Gilmour, Wright and Mason performed the Barrett compositions, ""Bike"" and ""Arnold Layne"", and Waters performed a solo version of his song ""Flickering Flame"". 
Wright died of an undisclosed form of cancer on 15 September 2008, aged 65. His surviving former bandmates praised him for his influence on the sound of Pink Floyd. 

Further performances and re-releases:
On 10 July 2010, Waters and Gilmour performed together at a charity event for the Hoping Foundation. The event, which raised money for Palestinian children, took place at Kiddington Hall in Oxfordshire, England, where they played to an audience of approximately 200. In return for Waters' appearance at the event, Gilmour agreed to perform ""Comfortably Numb"" at one of Waters' upcoming performances of The Wall. On 12 May 2011, at The O2 Arena in London, Gilmour honoured his commitment to Waters. Gilmour sang the first and second chorus and played the two guitar solos. Near the end of the show, after the wall had fallen down, Waters said to the crowd: ""So now we know tonight was the night when David did me the enormous honour of coming to play 'Comfortably Numb'. So, please welcome David Gilmour! ... By a strange and extraordinary, happy coincidence, there is another remnant of our old band here tonight. Please welcome Mr. Nick Mason to the stage!"" Gilmour and Mason, with respectively a mandolin and a tambourine, joined Waters and the rest of his band for ""Outside the Wall"". 
On 26 September 2011, Pink Floyd and EMI launched an exhaustive re-release campaign under the title Why Pink Floyd...?, reissuing the band's back catalogue in newly remastered versions, including ""Experience"" and ""Immersion"" multi-disc multi-format editions. James Guthrie, co-producer of The Wall, remastered the albums. 

The Endless River:

In 2012, Gilmour and Mason decided to revisit recordings made with Wright, mainly during the Division Bell sessions, to create a new Pink Floyd album. They recruited session musicians to help record new parts and ""generally harness studio technology"". Mason described the album as a tribute to Wright: ""I think this record is a good way of recognising a lot of what he does and how his playing was at the heart of the Pink Floyd sound. Listening back to the sessions, it really brought home to me what a special player he was."" Waters was not involved. 
Samson announced The Endless River in July 2014 on Twitter. Details were announced on Pink Floyd's website on 7 July, describing it as ""mainly ambient"" and instrumental music. It was released 7 November 2014; it is the second Pink Floyd album distributed by Parlophone following the release of the 20th anniversary editions of The Division Bell earlier in 2014. It became the most pre-ordered album of all time on Amazon UK,and debuted at number one in several countries.The vinyl edition was the fastest-selling UK vinyl release of 2014 and the fastest-selling since 1997.The album received mixed reviews. 
Gilmour stated that The Endless River is Pink Floyd's last album, saying: ""I think we have successfully commandeered the best of what there is ... It's a shame, but this is the end."" There was no tour to support the album, as Gilmour said it was ""kind of impossible"" without Wright. 

Musicianship:

Genres:
Considered one of the UK's first psychedelic music groups, Pink Floyd began their career at the vanguard of London's underground music scene. Some categorise their work from that era as a space rock. According to Rolling Stone: ""By 1967, they had developed an unmistakably psychedelic sound, performing long, loud suitelike compositions that touched on hard rock, blues, country, folk, and electronic music."" Released in 1968, the song ""Careful with That Axe, Eugene"" helped galvanise their reputation as an art rock group. Critics also describe them as an acid rock band. By the late 1960s, the press had begun to label their music progressive rock. O'Neill Surber comments on the music of Pink Floyd: 

Rarely will you find Floyd dishing up catchy hooks, tunes short enough for air-play, or predictable three-chord blues progressions; and never will you find them spending much time on the usual pop pablum of romance, partying, or self-hype. Their sonic universe is expansive, intense, and challenging ... Where most other bands neatly fit the songs to the music, the two forming a sort of autonomous and seamless whole complete with memorable hooks, Pink Floyd tends to set lyrics within a broader soundscape that often seems to have a life of its own ... Pink Floyd employs extended, stand-alone instrumentals which are never mere vehicles for showing off virtuoso but are planned and integral parts of the performance. 

In 1968, Wright commented on Pink Floyd's sonic reputation: ""It's hard to see why we were cast as the first British psychedelic group. We never saw ourselves that way ... we realised that we were, after all, only playing for fun ... tied to no particular form of music, we could do whatever we wanted ... the emphasis ... is firmly on spontaneity and improvisation."" Waters gave a less enthusiastic assessment of the band's early sound: ""There wasn't anything 'grand' about it. We were laughable. We were useless. We couldn't play at all so we had to do something stupid and 'experimental'... Syd was a genius, but I wouldn't want to go back to playing ""Interstellar Overdrive"" for hours and hours."" Unconstrained by conventional pop formats, Pink Floyd were innovators of progressive rock during the 1970s and ambient music during the 1980s. 

Gilmour's guitar work:

""While Waters was Floyd's lyricist and conceptualist, Gilmour was the band's voice and its main instrumental focus."" 

--Alan di Perna, in Guitar World, May 2006

Critic Alan di Perna praised Gilmour's guitar work as an integral element of Pink Floyd's sound.Rolling Stone ranked Gilmour number 14 in their ""100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time"" list and di Perna described him as the most important guitarist of the 1970s, calling him ""the missing link between Hendrix and Van Halen."" In 2006, Gilmour commented on his playing technique: ""My fingers make a distinctive sound ... they aren't very fast, but I think I am instantly recognisable ... The way I play melodies is connected to things like Hank Marvin and the Shadows"". Gilmour's ability to use fewer notes than most to express himself without sacrificing strength or beauty drew a favourable comparison to jazz trumpeter Miles Davis. 
In 2006, Guitar World writer Jimmy Brown described Gilmour's guitar style as ""characterised by simple, huge-sounding riffs; gutsy, well-paced solos; and rich, ambient chordal textures."" According to Brown, Gilmour's solos on ""Money"", ""Time"" and ""Comfortably Numb"" ""cut through the mix like a laser beam through fog."" Brown described the ""Time"" solo as ""a masterpiece of phrasing and motivic development ... Gilmour paces himself throughout and builds upon his initial idea by leaping into the upper register with gut-wrenching one-and-one-half-step 'over bends', soulful triplet arpeggios and a typically impeccable bar vibrato."" Brown described Gilmour's sense of phrasing as intuitive, singling it out as perhaps his best asset as a lead guitarist. Gilmour explained how he achieved his signature tone: ""I usually use a fuzz box, a delay and a bright EQ setting ... to get singing sustain ... you need to play loud -- at or near the feedback threshold. It's just so much more fun to play ... when bent notes slice right through you like a razor blade."" 

Sonic experimentation:
Throughout their career, Pink Floyd experimented with their sound. Their second single, ""See Emily Play"" premiered at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London, on 12 May 1967. During the performance, the group first used an early quadraphonic device called an Azimuth Co-ordinator. The device enabled the controller, usually Wright, to manipulate the band's amplified sound, combined with recorded tapes, projecting the sounds 270 degrees around a venue, achieving a sonic swirling effect. In 1972, they purchased a custom-built PA which featured an upgraded four-channel, 360-degree system. 
Waters experimented with the EMS Synthi A and VCS 3 synthesisers on Pink Floyd pieces such as ""On the Run"", ""Welcome to the Machine"", and ""In the Flesh?"". He used a Binson Echorec 2 echo effect on his bass-guitar track for ""One of These Days"". 
Pink Floyd used innovative sound effects and state of the art audio recording technology during the recording of The Final Cut. Mason's contributions to the album were almost entirely limited to work with the experimental Holophonic system, an audio processing technique used to simulate a three-dimensional effect. The system used a conventional stereo tape to produce an effect that seemed to move the sound around the listener's head when they were wearing headphones. The process enabled an engineer to simulate moving the sound to behind, above or beside the listener's ears. 

Film scores:
Pink Floyd also composed several film scores, starting in 1968, with The Committee. In 1969, they recorded the score for Barbet Schroeder's film More. The soundtrack proved beneficial; not only did it pay well but, along with A Saucerful of Secrets, the material they created became part of their live shows for some time thereafter. While composing the soundtrack for director Michelangelo Antonioni's film Zabriskie Point, the band stayed at a luxury hotel in Rome for almost a month. Waters claimed that, without Antonioni's constant changes to the music, they would have completed the work in less than a week. Eventually he used only three of their recordings. One of the pieces turned down by Antonioni, called ""The Violent Sequence"", later became ""Us and Them"", included on 1973's The Dark Side of the Moon. In 1971, the band again worked with Schroeder on the film La Vallée, for which they released a soundtrack album called Obscured by Clouds. They composed the material in about a week at the Château d'Hérouville near Paris, and upon its release, it became Pink Floyd's first album to break into the top 50 on the US Billboard chart. 

Live performances:

Regarded as pioneers of live music performance and renowned for their lavish stage shows, Pink Floyd also set high standards in sound quality, making use of innovative sound effects and quadraphonic speaker systems. From their earliest days, they employed visual effects to accompany their psychedelic rock music while performing at venues such as the UFO Club in London. Their slide-and-light show was one of the first in British rock, and it helped them became popular among London's underground. 
To celebrate the launch of the London Free School's magazine International Times in 1966, they performed in front of 2,000 people at the opening of the Roundhouse, attended by celebrities including Paul McCartney and Marianne Faithfull. In mid-1966, road manager Peter Wynne-Willson joined their road crew, and updated the band's lighting rig with some innovative ideas including the use of polarisers, mirrors and stretched condoms. After their record deal with EMI, Pink Floyd purchased a Ford Transit van, then considered extravagant band transportation. On 29 April 1967, they headlined an all-night event called The 14 Hour Technicolour Dream at the Alexandra Palace, London. Pink Floyd arrived at the festival at around three o'clock in the morning after a long journey by van and ferry from the Netherlands, taking the stage just as the sun was beginning to rise. In July 1969, precipitated by their space-related music and lyrics, they took part in the live BBC television coverage of the Apollo 11 moon landing, performing an instrumental piece which they called ""Moonhead"". 
In November 1974, they employed for the first time the large circular screen that would become a staple of their live shows. In 1977, they employed the use of a large inflatable floating pig named ""Algie"". Filled with helium and propane, Algie, while floating above the audience, would explode with a loud noise during the In the Flesh Tour. The behaviour of the audience during the tour, as well as the large size of the venues, proved a strong influence on their concept album The Wall. The subsequent The Wall Tour featured a 40 feet (12 m) high wall, built from cardboard bricks, constructed between the band and the audience. They projected animations onto the wall, while gaps allowed the audience to view various scenes from the story. They commissioned the creation of several giant inflatables to represent characters from the story. One striking feature of the tour was the performance of ""Comfortably Numb"". While Waters sang his opening verse, in darkness, Gilmour waited for his cue on top of the wall. When it came, bright blue and white lights would suddenly reveal him. Gilmour stood on a flightcase on castors, an insecure setup supported from behind by a technician. A large hydraulic platform supported both Gilmour and the tech. 
During the Division Bell Tour, an unknown person using the name Publius posted a message on an internet newsgroup inviting fans to solve a riddle supposedly concealed in the new album. White lights in front of the stage at the Pink Floyd concert in East Rutherford spelled out the words Enigma Publius. During a televised concert at Earls Court on 20 October 1994, someone projected the word ""enigma"" in large letters on to the backdrop of the stage. Mason later acknowledged that their record company had instigated the Publius Enigma mystery, rather than the band. 

Lyrical themes:
Marked by Waters' philosophical lyrics, Rolling Stone described Pink Floyd as ""purveyors of a distinctively dark vision"". Author Jere O'Neill Surber wrote: ""their interests are truth and illusion, life and death, time and space, causality and chance, compassion and indifference."" Waters identified empathy as a central theme in the lyrics of Pink Floyd. Author George Reisch described Meddle‍‍ '​‍s psychedelic opus, ""Echoes"", as ""built around the core idea of genuine communication, sympathy, and collaboration with others."" Despite having been labeled ""the gloomiest man in rock"", author Deena Weinstein described Waters as an existentialist, dismissing the unfavourable moniker as the result of misinterpretation by music critics. 

Disillusionment, absence, and non-being:
Waters' lyrics to Wish You Were Here‍‍ '​‍s ""Have a Cigar"" deal with a perceived lack of sincerity on the part of music industry representatives. The song illustrates a dysfunctional dynamic between the band and a record label executive who congratulates the group on their current sales success, implying that they are on the same team while revealing that he erroneously believes ""Pink"" is the name of one of the band members. According to author David Detmer, the album's lyrics deal with the ""dehumanizing aspects of the world of commerce"", a situation the artist must endure in order to reach their audience. 
Absence as a lyrical theme is common in the music of Pink Floyd. Examples include the absence of Barrett after 1968, and that of Waters' father, who died during the Second World War. Waters' lyrics also explored unrealized political goals and unsuccessful endeavors. Their film score, Obscured by Clouds, dealt with the loss of youthful exuberance that sometimes comes with aging. Longtime Pink Floyd album cover designer, Storm Thorgerson, described the lyrics of Wish You Were Here: ""The idea of presence withheld, of the ways that people pretend to be present while their minds are really elsewhere, and the devices and motivations employed psychologically by people to suppress the full force of their presence, eventually boiled down to a single theme, absence: The absence of a person, the absence of a feeling."" Waters commented: ""it's about none of us really being there ... it should have been called Wish We Were Here"". 
O'Neill Surber explored the lyrics of Pink Floyd and declared the issue of non-being a common theme in their music. Waters invoked non-being or non-existence in The Wall, with the lyrics to ""Comfortably Numb"": ""I caught a fleeting glimpse, out of the corner of my eye. I turned to look, but it was gone, I cannot put my finger on it now, the child is grown, the dream is gone."" Barrett referred to non-being in his final contribution to the band's catalogue, ""Jugband Blues"": ""I'm most obliged to you for making it clear that I'm not here."" 

Exploitation and oppression:
Author Patrick Croskery described Animals as a unique blend of the ""powerful sounds and suggestive themes"" of Dark Side with The Wall‍‍ '​‍s portrayal of artistic alienation. He drew a parallel between the album's political themes and that of Orwell's Animal Farm.Animals begins with a thought experiment, which asks: ""If you didn't care what happened to me. And I didn't care for you"", then develops a beast fable based on anthropomorphized characters using music to reflect the individual states of mind of each. The lyrics ultimately paint a picture of dystopia, the inevitable result of a world devoid of empathy and compassion, answering the question posed in the opening lines. 
The album's characters include the ""Dogs"", representing fervent capitalists, the ""Pigs"", symbolizing political corruption, and the ""Sheep"", who represent the exploited. Croskery described the ""Sheep"" as being in a ""state of delusion created by a misleading cultural identity"", a false consciousness. The ""Dog"", in his tireless pursuit of self-interest and success, ends up depressed and alone with no one to trust, utterly lacking emotional satisfaction after a life of exploitation. Waters used Mary Whitehouse as an example of a ""Pig""; being someone who in his estimation, used the power of the government to impose her values on society. At the album's conclusion, Waters returns to empathy with the lyrical statement: ""You know that I care what happens to you. And I know that you care for me too."" However, he also acknowledges that the ""Pigs"" are a continuing threat and reveals that he is a ""Dog"" who requires shelter, suggesting the need for a balance between state, commerce and community, versus an ongoing battle between them. 

Alienation, war, and insanity:

""When I say, 'I'll see you on the dark side of the moon'... what I mean is ... If you feel that you're the only one ... that you seem crazy because you think everything is crazy, you're not alone."" 

--Waters, quoted in Harris, 2005

O'Neill Surber compared the lyrics of Dark Side‍‍ '​‍s ""Brain Damage"" with Karl Marx‍‍ '​‍s theory of self-alienation; ""there's someone in my head, but it's not me."" The lyrics to Wish You Were Here‍‍ '​‍s ""Welcome to the Machine"" suggest what Marx called the alienation of the thing; the song's protagonist preoccupied with material possessions to the point that he becomes estranged from himself and others. Allusions to the alienation of man's species being can be found in Animals; the ""Dog"" reduced to living instinctively as a non-human. The ""Dogs"" become alienated from themselves to the extent that they justify their lack of integrity as a ""necessary and defensible"" position in ""a cutthroat world with no room for empathy or moral principle"" wrote Detmer.Alienation from others is a consistent theme in the lyrics of Pink Floyd, and it is a core element of The Wall. 
War, viewed as the most severe consequence of the manifestation of alienation from others, is also a core element of The Wall, and a recurring theme in the band's music. Waters' father died in combat during the Second World War, and his lyrics often alluded to the cost of war, including those from ""Corporal Clegg"" (1968), ""Free Four"" (1972), ""Us and Them"" (1973), ""When the Tigers Broke Free"" and ""The Fletcher Memorial Home"" from The Final Cut (1983), an album dedicated to his late father and subtitled A Requiem for the Postwar Dream. The themes and composition of The Wall express Waters' upbringing in an English society depleted of men after the Second World War, a condition that negatively affected his personal relationships with women. 
Waters' lyrics to The Dark Side of the Moon dealt with the pressures of modern life and how those pressures can sometimes cause insanity. He viewed the album's explication of mental illness as illuminating a universal condition. However, Waters also wanted the album to communicate positivity, calling it ""an exhortation ... to embrace the positive and reject the negative."" Reisch described The Wall as ""less about the experience of madness than the habits, institutions, and social structures that create or cause madness.""The Wall‍‍ '​‍s protagonist, Pink, is unable to deal with the circumstances of his life, and overcome by feelings of guilt, slowly closes himself off from the outside world inside a barrier of his own making. After he completes his estrangement from the world, Pink realises that he is ""crazy, over the rainbow"". He then considers the possibility that his condition may be his own fault: ""have I been guilty all this time?"" Realizing his greatest fear, Pink believes that he has let everyone down, his overbearing mother wisely choosing to smother him, the teachers rightly criticising his poetic aspirations, and his wife justified in leaving him. He then stands trial for ""showing feelings of an almost human nature"", further exacerbating his alienation of species being. As with the writings of philosopher Michel Foucault, Waters' lyrics suggest Pink's insanity is a product of modern life, the elements of which, ""custom, codependancies, and psychopathologies"", contribute to his angst, according to Reisch. 

Recognition and influence:

Pink Floyd are one of the most commercially successful and influential rock bands of all time. They have sold more than 250 million records worldwide, including 75 million certified units in the United States, and 37.9 million albums sold in the US since 1993. The Sunday Times Rich List, Music Millionaires 2013 (UK), ranked Waters at number 12 with an estimated fortune of £150 million, Gilmour at number 27 with £85 million and Mason at number 37 with £50 million.

They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005, and the Hit Parade Hall of Fame in 2010. 
The music of Pink Floyd influenced numerous artists; David Bowie called Barrett a significant inspiration, and The Edge of U2 bought his first delay pedal after hearing the opening guitar chords to ""Dogs"" from Animals. Other bands who cite Pink Floyd as an influence include Queen, Tool, Radiohead, Kraftwerk, Marillion, Queensrÿche, Nine Inch Nails, the Orb and the Smashing Pumpkins. 
Pink Floyd were also admirers of the Monty Python comedy group, and helped finance their 1975 film Monty Python and the Holy Grail.]",0.262567648943,0.893796,"[art rock, progressive rock, space rock, psychedelic rock, symphonic rock, album rock, rock]",0.7836,0.767896593962,0.274519387735,0.363647000784,0.216003275124,0.896543514943,5.0,0.0831979377804,0.455335925686,1.0,0.0345374077658,0.740014496624,4.0,0.17641485409,1

Old Crow Medicine Show's songs are represented by Downtown Music Publishing. 

History:

Early:

Ketch Secor and Critter Fuqua first met in the seventh grade in Harrisonburg, Virginia and began playing music together. They performed open mics at the Little Grill diner, as did Robert St. Ours who went on to found The Hackensaw Boys. Secor's early influences included ""driving up to Mt. Jackson, VA to the bluegrass Saturday night in the summer. And going up to Davis and Elkins College to participate in the Old Time Music week there, and meeting guys like Richie Stearns."" Secor formed the Route 11 Boys with St. Ours and his brothers, and performed often at Little Grill. 
Willie Watson first met Ben Gould in high school in Watkins Glen, New York (Schuyler County), and began playing music together. Both Watson and Gould dropped out of school and formed the band The Funnest Game. Their brand of electric/old-time was heavily influenced by the old-time music scene prominent in Tompkins and Schuyler County, New York, including The Horse Flies and The Highwoods Stringband. 

""Wagon Wheel"":
Fuqua, school friend and future bandmate, first brought home a Bob Dylan bootleg from a family trip to London containing a rough outtake called ""Rock Me, Mama"" (from the ""Pat Garrett and Billy The Kid"" soundtrack sessions) and passed it to Secor. Not ""so much a song as a sketch, crudely recorded featuring most prominently a stomping boot, the candy-coated chorus and a mumbled verse that was hard to make out"", the tune kept going through Secor's mind. A few months later, while attending Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire, and ""feeling homesick for the South,"" he added verses about ""hitchhiking his way home full of romantic notions put in his head by the Beat poets and, most of all, Dylan."" Dylan was a major influence on the young musician, as he puts it: 

""I listened to Bob Dylan and nothing else. Nothin' but Bob for four years. It was like schooling. Every album and every outtake of every album and every live record I could get my hands on and every show I could go see live. I was a teenager who was really turned on to Bob."" 

The Dylan outtake, generally titled ""Rock Me Mama"", came out of recording sessions for the Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid movie soundtrack (1973) in Burbank, California. Secor says it "". . was an outtake of something he had mumbled out on one of those tapes. I sang it all around the country from about 17 to 26, before I ever even thought, 'oh I better look into this.'"" 
When Secor sought copyright on the song in 2003 to release it on O.C.M.S. in (2004), he discovered Dylan credited the phrase ""Rock me, mama"" to bluesman Arthur ""Big Boy"" Crudup, who likely got it from a Big Bill Broonzy recording. As Secor says: ""In a way, it's taken something like 85 years to get completed."" Secor and Dylan signed a co-writing agreement, and share copyright on the song; agreeing to a ""50-50 split in authorship."" 
Secor later met Dylan's son, Jakob, who said ""it made sense that I was a teenager when I did that, because no one in their 30s would have the guts to try to write a Bob Dylan song."" The song would be an early entry in the group's catalog when it formed a few years later. Officially released twice, on an early EP and their second album (""O.C.M.S."" in 2004), the song would become the group's signature song--going gold in 2011 and platinum in 2013. 

Upstate New York/Canada/North Carolina:
After the breakup of the Route 11 Boys, Secor attended Ithaca College. He brought Fuqua up to New York State, where they met Willie Watson. Watson dissolved The Funnest Game and they assembled players all around Ithaca, New York ""where there is a very lively old-time music scene"", including Kevin Hayes They recorded an album that they could sell on the road--a cassette of ten songs called Trans:mission. Fuqua says of the influence of that region . . 

'Ithaca and that surrounding area was a big influence on us. We wouldn't be here without a lot of the people we met there, like Richie Stearns, the Red Hots and Mac Benford. All those old-time banjo players brought the music from the South back up to New York, and it was kind of a hotbed.' 

The group left Ithaca for their Trans:mission tour in October 1998. They busked their way west across Canada and circled back east again in the Spring of 1999 when they moved into a farmhouse on Beech Mountain, near Boone, North Carolina. They were embraced by the Appalachian community, and their repertoire of old-time songs grew as they played with local musicians."" 

Busking break:

One day the group were busking outside a pharmacy called Boone Drug--""playing on Doc's old corner"" where he'd ""started playing in the 1950s"" on King Street in Boone, North Carolina--when the daughter of folk-country legend Doc Watson (d. May 29, 2012) heard them. Certain her father would be impressed, she led the blind musician over for a listen. The group ""struck up 'Oh My Little Darling', a well-known old-time song they thought Doc would like."" When they finished, he said: ""Boys, that was some of the most authentic old-time music I've heard in a long while. You almost got me crying."" Doc invited the band to participate in his annual MerleFest music festival in Wilkesboro, North Carolina (for 2000). 
To Secor: ""That gig changed our lives and we look to it as a pivotal turning point as Old Crow Medicine Show. He and Fuqua have written a song ""about Doc Watson. About being on the corner in Boone and him discovering us. It honors Doc and the high country blues sound."" 
Busking has ""always been our heart and soul,"" claims Secor. ""Our performance comes out of all those years spent cutting our teeth on the street corner."" The earliest beginnings of the group involved busking in the Northeast U.S., attracting fresh talent. Guitjo player Kevin Hayes--originally from Haverhill, Massachusetts--was in Bar Harbor, Maine raking blueberries when he encountered Secor ""on the street in front of a jewelry store playing the banjo."" Bassist Morgan Jahnig joined the group as a result of a ""random"" encounter with early Old Crow performing on the streets of Nashville in 2000. Guitarist Gill Landry first met the group in 2000 while both were street performing during Mardi Gras in New Orleans, joining full-time in 2007. 
To promote Carry Me Back Home (2012), the group did a series of ""guerilla"" shows around Nashville, including busking in front of the Ryman Auditorium where they performed ""Sewanee Mountain Catfight"" for an ""unsuspecting crowd of tourists."" 

Grand Ole Opry:
The big busking break led to the act's relocation to Nashville in October 2000. At MerleFest, Secor explains, Sally Williams ""from the Grand Ole Opry . . invited us to participate in some summer music events at the Grand Ole Opry House doing our street act, our busking, and that's why we came to Nashville . ."" Williams first booked them for ""an Opryland Plaza outdoor show."" In Nashville they were ""embraced and mentored"" by Marty Stuart, the president of the Grand Ole Opry, who first spied the group at the Nashville-area Uncle Dave Macon Days festival and added them to his ""Electric Barnyard old-fashioned country variety package show bus tour"" with acts like Merle Haggard, Connie Smith, and BR5-49. Soon they were opening for ""everyone from Loretta Lynn and Dolly Parton to Ricky Skaggs and Del McCoury . ."" 

The group made their Grand Ole Opry debut at the Ryman Auditorium, ""The Mother Church of Country Music"", in January 2001. Given just four minutes on stage, they played their original ""Tear It Down""--a ""singing jug-band romp about punishing infidelity""--and received a ""rare first-time-out standing ovation, and a call for an encore."" In August 2013, Stuart unexpectedly appeared onstage at the Ohio Theatre in Cleveland, where the group was performing, to invite them to become official members of the Opry. They were formally inducted at a special ceremony at the Grand Ole Opry House in Nashville, September 17, 2013. 

Nettwerk:
Shortly after their Opry debut, the group signed with Bobby Cudd at Monterey Peninsula Artists, who also represented Robert Earl Keen, the Dave Matthews Band, Chris Isaak, Aerosmith, and Fiona Apple. They went on their ""first real tour"" May 2001, opening for the Del McCoury band. Appearances at the 2003 South by Southwest (SXSW) in Austin--a ""scene"" that's ""all about getting behind young artists"", as Secor puts it--led to the group being signed by Nettwerk, securing their recording future for the next several years. Their first Nettwerk offering, Old Crow Medicine Show in 2004 (popularly known as O.C.M.S.), was produced by Dave Rawlings and mixes ""old blues and jug band music with originals that fit smoothly into the tradition""--including the Fuqua ""Take 'em Away"" and Secor ""Wagon Wheel"". More than 100,000 copies of O.C.M.S. were sold, behind a ""rigorous tour schedule and a memorable live show""; what CMT regarded as ""an impressive number for a new band that didn't know much about record deals and everything that goes with it."" 
Big Iron World (2006), another Rawlings production, added a sense of urgency on new songs like ""I Hear Them All"". They recorded Tennessee Pusher (2008) in Hollywood with producer Don Was, ""rocking harder"" with ""Alabama High Test"" and ""Methamphetamine"". Secor says the band ""figured they'd take some leftover material from the first album, add a few traditional songs and suddenly have a new record."" But, he says . . 

"". . it wasn't that easy. Pretty soon, after we realized that that wasn't going to work that way, the gods up above started sending down some lightning bolts of good music and we were able to collect some new material--write some and craft some--that has made the record what it is."" 

Starting with an appearance on radio show A Prairie Home Companion with Garrison Keillor in 2004  they've had a recurring engagement with the show, including several appearances in the show's home state of Minnesota and special live shows--including the Hollywood Bowl and a New Year's Eve show at the Ryman. They've participated in three of the show's Cinecasts, all from the Fitzgerald Theater in Saint Paul, ""seen on movie screens across North America."" 

The Big Surprise Tour featuring Old Crow, Gillian Welch and Dave Rawlings, the Felice Brothers, and Justin Townes Earle kicked off in Hampton Beach, New Hampshire August 2009. The ""nine-stop tour"" included shows in Knoxville, Nashville, Boston, New York and Philadelphia--and ""mark(ed) the first major showcasing of the Dave Rawlings Machine."" 
In April 2011 the group joined Mumford and Sons and Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros on The Railroad Revival Tour, a tour inspired by the Festival Express tour across Canada in 1970 that included Buddy Guy, Janis Joplin, The Grateful Dead, and The Band. Traveling exclusively in vintage rail cars, the three bands performed in six ""unique outdoor locations"" over the course of a week starting in Oakland, California. They appear in the musical documentary about the tour, Big Easy Express directed by Emmett Malloy, which premiered March 2012 at the South by Southwest Film Conference and Festival (SXSW Film) in Austin, Texas--winning the Headliner Audience Award. 

Big Easy Express won the Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video in 2013. 

Hiatus/Founder returns:
In August 2011, the group announced they were on hiatus, cancelling three shows scheduled for the following month, with ""little word from the band on whether there would continue to be a band."" Original member Willie Watson left in Fall of 2011, a couple months before Fuqua returned. 
Recording of their next album had been largely done before the break. 

Founding member Fuqua rejoined the group in January 2012, after leaving in 2004 ""initially leaving to go to rehab for his drinking, then staying out to attend college."" Cory Younts, who left Old Crow a few months into 2012 to perform in Jack White's backup band Los Buzzardos (or The Buzzards) on world tour to support White's album Blunderbuss, returned to the group in 2013. 

Carry Me Back (2012):
Carry Me Back was released July 17, 2012 on According to Our Records (or ATO Records). Founded by Dave Matthews and his business manager Coran Capshaw in 2000 as a division of RCA Records. Recorded at Sound Emporium Studios in Nashville, the album was produced by Ted Hutt who had worked with Gaslight Anthem, Dropkick Murphys, and Flogging Molly. The name derives from ""Carry Me Back to Old Virginny"", former official state song of Virginia. 
The song ""Levi"" is ""about a soldier who grew up in the wild hillbilly woods of Virginia."" First Lieutenant Leevi Barnard--from Ararat, Virginia--on his first tour of duty overseas with the National Guard, was ""killed by a suicide bomber"" in Baghdad's Dora Market in 2009. Near the end of the NPR broadcast, where Secor first heard the story in 2009, several of the late lieutenant's friends, part of the funeral congregation, ""broke into Barnard's favorite song"" . . ""Wagon Wheel"". ""Genevieve"" by Landry is ""an evocative eulogy of a Creole queen who steals a young man's heart."" 
The album ""sold over 17,000 copies in its debut week, landing at #22 on the Billboard Albums Chart, leading to both the band's best ever sales week and their highest ever charting position. It was #1 on both the Bluegrass and Folk charts and is the #4 Country album in the nation"" (as of July 31, 2012). To promote the album, the group played five unannounced shows at historical locations around Nashville (including one surprise show in front of Ryman Auditorium) and toured July/August 2012 with The Lumineers, The Milk Carton Kids, and Pokey LaFarge and the South City Three visiting such cities as: Louisville, Cincinnati, Nashville, Richmond, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, New York, Boston, and Atlanta. 
American Songwriter, and London-based The Independent and The Financial Times, each gave the album 4 out of 5 stars. To Secor the album ""is as close as that original inspiration to be in a band as when we first got started. It's very much the root of our sound."" 

""Carry Me Back exploits a kaleidoscopic galaxy of joyous old-timey string sounds updated for the 21st century."" 
--Dave Dawson, Nu Country

Chance McCoy--who grew up in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, but was born in Washington, D.C.--joined just prior to the Carry Me Back promotional tour in 2012. As a teacher of old-time music at Augusta Heritage Center of Davis & Elkins College in Elkins, West Virginia he'd attracted the attention of the group who ""wanted to get Old Crow back together and on the road again."" ""He got the gig"" because Secor ""knew that anyone who worked at Augusta knew all about old-time music."" 

Remedy (2014):
Remedy was released in July 2014 by ATO Records and produced by Ted Hutt--who produced their previous studio record. The album features a collaboration with Bob Dylan, ""Sweet Amarillo"", and ballads ""Dearly Departed Friend"" and ""Firewater"", the latter written by Fuqua. 

Musical style:

""The sound is invigorating on their recordings, but at a live show the fiddle, banjo, and harmonica are practically on fire, creating a crazy, addictive mix of some of the best traditional music America has to offer with the intensity of a modern-day rock show."" 

Elizabeth Pandolfi, Charleston City Paper

Variously described as old-time, Americana, bluegrass, alt-country, and ""Folk-Country"", the group started out infusing old Appalachian sounds with new punk energy. Country Music Television notes their ""tunes from jug bands and traveling shows, back porches and dance halls, southern Appalachian string music and Memphis blues."" Gabrielle Gray, executive director of the International Bluegrass Music Museum--who sponsors ROMP: Bluegrass Roots & Branches Festival, which Old Crow headlined one night in 2012--holds the group ""is in the direction of progressive bluegrass."" Their live touring show has been described as a ""folk-bluegrass-alt-country blend."" 
""We just knew we wanted to combine the technical side of the old sound with the energy of a Nirvana,"" states Fuqua. Starting from old-time music in the Appalachian hills, the group found themselves ""making a foray into electric instruments and 'really knocking up the rock 'n' roll tree' on their 2008 release 'Tennessee Pusher'."" On the documentary ""Big Easy Express"" about the Railroad Revival Tour with Mumford & Sons and Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros they ""practice(d) a complementary variation of folk"" bringing ""a pleasingly smoky amalgam of country, bluegrass, and blues."" With ""Carry Me Back"" (2012) they've ""circled back to the original sound that so excited (Secor) and Fuqua as kids . . full of old-timey string sounds updated for the 21st century -- sing-a-longs that lift the soul, ballads that rend the heart and a few moments of pure exhilaration."" 

Songwriting:

""It takes a lot to figure out how to keep one foot in old time and one foot in all time. It's a bit of a dance to be rooted and modern at the same time. I think we've figured out how to write those songs that sound like they were sung by some campfire 85 years ago, but sound good blasted from the stereo of a Ford Ranchero in a Burger King parking lot somewhere outside of Enid."" 

Ketch Secor

Early on the group didn't perform songs they'd written, instead drawing on a storehouse of pre-war jug band, string band, minstrel show, blues and folk fare. As with other young groups in the genre, driven by all that punk music energy, they played this old material ""fast and hard"". When they started writing original material they distinguished themselves ""from the crowded field of New Wave string bands as genuine stars. And both groups have done it by writing new songs more ambitious than mere rewrites of old hillbilly and blues numbers."" Songs they write often have a socially conscious theme, such as ""I Hear Them All"", ""Ways Of Man"", ""Ain't It Enough"", and ""Levi"". 
Secor admits to developing ""the habit of writing what he calls 'stolen melody songs'""--in much the same way he'd created ""Wagon Wheel"", carrying on in the folk tradition--""like when he penned fresh, war tax-themed lyrics to a tune that had already passed through other wholesale re-writes during its descent from old-time Scots-Irish balladry."" Dave Rawlings states: ""I've always thought that a really important thing that the Old Crow Medicine Show brought to the table was new songs--some reinterpreted old ones, some really nicely written and brand new--with the old flavor, but also with that vitality."" 

Influences:
An early Secor influence was John Hartford who performed for his first grade class in Missouri, making him want ""to play the banjo after that;"" and the first song he ever learned to play was Tom Paxton's ""Ramblin' Boy"".Guns N' Roses was Fuqua's ""first influence"": when they released Appetite for Destruction (1987), while he was in seventh grade, he knew he wanted to be a musician. He also claims AC/DC and Nirvana as influences ""and then into blues and then into more obscure fiddlers. Some Conjunto from down in San Antonio."" ""Take 'Em Away"", written when he was 17, is ""loosely based on Mance Lipscomb, a blues singer and sharecropper from Navasota County"" who he says ""was a big influence on me."" 

Naming his major influences, Secor states: ""Certainly, Bob Dylan . . Bob Dylan . . Bob Dylan. More than anything else. More than any book or song or story or play. The work and the recorded work of Bob Dylan. It's the most profound influence on me. And then the other people that really influenced me tend to be the same people who influenced Bob Dylan."" Fuqua concurs on Dylan's influence: 

""He's a link to Woody Guthrie, who's a link to an even earlier form of American music history. He's . . a great doorway for all sorts of artists because he's not just folk, or just rock. . . I think bands like us, Mumford and Sons, and Gillian Welch and David Rawlings are sort of doing what he has done before, in that we take our own experiences and observations and put them into songs made of traditional, American roots form. That form is still a great vehicle for songs, whether the song is about love, the Iraq War or anything else."" 

The Dylan doorway led to the first recordings of the New Lost City Ramblers, the Jim Kweskin Jug Band, Canned Heat, The Lovin' Spoonful, Dylan and The Band in the basement, and the Grateful Dead. 

Impact:

""While it would be going a bit far to say Old Crow sparked a full-blown folk revival, these guys have contributed mightily to a major shift in youthful attitudes toward ownership, authenticity and what it means to feel included in a musical experience: lyrics don't have to be strict autobiography to connect; songs don't have to be entirely original to showcase originality; and younger generations need not turn up their noses at music that doesn't treat them like they're at the center of the universe."" 

Jewly Hight, American Songwriter

When Secor, Fuqua, and company first got together ""old-timey pickers their age were few and far between. Modern rock was still a force to be reckoned with. Now hard-driving string bands are where it's at."" Fuqua recalls: 

""When we started the band in '98, you didn't see anybody our age playing banjos or upright basses or fiddles, or playing this music. I mean, you did if you went to the fiddle festivals at Mt. Airy or in Galax, Virginia. But . . now you throw a stone in any direction . . you'll hit someone in a band who's . . playing banjo or playing these old-time tunes."" 

To Americana Music Association (AMA) President Jed Hilly, the historic path of Americana music passes through the group: ""The baton is passed from Emmylou Harris to Gillian Welch and David Rawlings to Old Crow Medicine Show to the Avett Brothers."" Emmylou Harris was, in fact . . 

"". . among the gateway artists who helped Mumford and bandmates Ben Lovett, Ted Dwane and Winston Marshall discover their love for American roots music. It started with the 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' soundtrack . . That eventually led them to the Old Crow Medicine Show and then deep immersion in old-timey sounds from America's long-neglected past."" 

""You can't swing a cat these days without hitting a hipster with a banjo in his hands. At least part of the credit for this phenomenon goes to Old Crow Medicine Show."" 

Chrissie Dickinson, Chicago Tribune

Marcus Mumford, front man of Mumford & Sons, recognizes the group's influence: ""I first heard Old Crow's music when I was, like, 16, 17, and that really got me into, like, folk music, bluegrass. I mean, I'd listened to a lot of Dylan, but I hadn't really ventured into the country world so much. So Old Crow were the band that made me fall in love with country music."" Mumford acknowledges in ""Big Easy Express"", Emmett Malloy's ""moving documentary"" about the vintage train tour they'd invited Old Crow to join them on, that ""the band inspired them to pick up the banjo and start their now famous country nights in London."" 
Old Crow received the 2013 Trailblazer Award from the Americana Music Association.

The darker Loyalty To Loyalty followed two years later, and 2011's Mine Is Yours introduced deeper anthemic qualities to the eclectic group's catalog.   Dear Miss Lonelyhearts, which features the rollicking, energetic single ""Miracle Mile,"" is Cold War Kids' first release with former Modest Mouse and Murder City Devils guitarist Dann Gallucci, who also handled its production alongside Lars Stalfors.   ""We were shaken up, ready to let certain songs go further than before by trying new styles and arrangements, while keeping others sparse and caring more about the finished product and less about how we got there,"" explains frontman Nathan Willet about the ten-track album, which was recorded at the band's private studio in San Pedro, CA.

Jonnie Russell (guitar, vocals, keyboards, piano, percussion, melodica) and Matt Aveiro (drums, percussion) are both former members of the band. 
Forming in 2004 in Fullerton, the band's early releases came from independent record label Monarchy Music. In 2006, Cold War Kids signed with Downtown/V2 and released their major label debut Robbers & Cowards to cult appeal from fans and critics. 2008's Loyalty to Loyalty and 2011's Mine Is Yours saw the band develop different musical sounds and lyrical content throughout to mixed reviews. In 2013, Cold War Kids released their fourth album Dear Miss Lonelyhearts. Their most recent album Hold My Home was released on October 21, 2014. 

History:

Early years and Robbers & Cowards (2004-2006):

Cold War Kids started in 2004 in downtown Fullerton when Nathan Willett, Matt Maust and Matt Aveiro met regularly in Jonnie Russell's apartment above a restaurant called Mulberry Street. Maust came up with the band's name during his travels in Eastern Europe with his brother in Budapest, where they found a park with statues that had been dumped after Communism fell. Seeing that there was a playground in that park, Maust stated ""...being in that environment just made the phrase 'Cold War Kids' pop into my head. I may have heard it before. I'm a cold war kid, too -- I was born in 1979."" The band relocated to Whittier, California and began recording their first demo, which Monarchy Music released as the EP Mulberry Street (based on the restaurant they regularly met) in spring 2005. Between tours, the band released two more EPs: With Our Wallets Full and Up in Rags, in 2006. Monarchy Music would re-release those EPs as one compilation album titled Up in Rags/With Our Wallets Full in 2006. 
In summer 2006, Cold War Kids signed with Downtown Records and started work on their debut album. The album titled Robbers & Cowards was released on October 10, 2006 with sales close to 200,000 copies. Critics were impressed with the band's blues rock sound and lyrics that told morose tales of yesteryear: Joe Tacopino of PopMatters said that ""These ambitious youngsters are definitely worth the trip, even without the ostentatious vocal harmonies."" Jeff Weiss of Stylus Magazine called the album ""It's a good debut, maybe even a very good one. Whether or not this band will achieve greatness remains anybody's guess."" 
One of the album's biggest detractors came from Marc Hogan of Pitchfork Media, who criticized the band for its songwriting, melodies and Christian symbolism, saying that ""Robbers and Cowards insults our intelligence a few times too often."" Cat Dirt Sez of the San Diego CityBeat said that Hogan's review was an example of lazy journalism, with lead guitarist Jonnie Russell saying that the reviewer wanted a wittier approach to the album rather than a thoughtful assessment of it. 

Loyalty to Loyalty (2008):
After two years of non-stop worldwide touring and an eventual relocation to Long Beach, California, Cold War Kids went back into the studio in spring 2008 with the producer of their first record, Kevin Augunas. Nathan described the record making process: ""Throughout the record making process, we would write songs in our own little practice studio, then we'd go into the studio for, like, two days and record three or four songs, then go back into our own practice studio for, like, a few weeks. So really it was over the span of four months or something. Actual studio days probably like 15 days. We don't love being in a studio; we focus more on the writing."" 
The band's second album, Loyalty to Loyalty, represented a departure from its debut, featuring a lot of narrative storytelling, as well as political and philosophical references. In an interview with NPR, Nathan described the songwriting process for the album: ""The choices that we make have always been organic ones, to try to grow at a rate that makes sense,"" Willett says. ""Not necessarily talking about, 'Is there a great single? Is this a big breakthrough for us? Is this the next level for us?' But just write songs. Yeah, there is a stress, and the way we deal with it is to ignore it."" 
Loyalty to Loyalty was released on September 23, 2008 to generally positive reviews from critics. Bart Blasengame of Paste called it ""a better-than-solid album from a band that seemed equipped to someday make a classic one."" James McMahon of NME said that ""Almost in defiance of poor sales and cult following, CWK and their charming second album embody everything you hoped music might be."" 

Behave Yourself and Mine Is Yours (2009-2011):
The band spent the end of 2008 and most of 2009 on the road touring for the album, highlighted by a national tour with Death Cab for Cutie. In between touring, the band returned to the studio to record what would become their seventh EP Behave Yourself. In an interview with Flavorwire, Maust talked about the differences between this and Loyalty: ""It's basically the happier, more vibrant songs that didn't really fit on the Loyalty album. We realized that in a way, we were starting to work ahead of ourselves, so this EP works as a nice bridge between records.""Behave Yourself was released digitally on iTunes on December 21, 2009 and given a physical version on January 19, 2010. 

The band went back into the studio in February 2010. Nathan, when speaking to Filter Magazine, said, ""Album three is in the works now. We are working with a producer named Jacquire King. He has a sweet and eclectic roster of Modest Mouse, the last Norah Jones record, Tom Waits' Mule Variations, the last Kings of Leon record...So, he is going to work miracles with us. All of our music has always been written entirely by us, without any influence, so to have him step in and help us with the direction is tremendous. I was just watching the Wilco Documentary again, and I think that in many ways Wilco is to country/Americana as Cold War Kids is to soul/punk. We are taking what we do to the next level on this record. The EP is the final reminder of the good old days of quick and fun, minimal Cold War Kids recording."" 
Mine Is Yours was released on January 25, 2011 and garnered mixed reviews from critics.Billboard said that ""the band has emerged with a set that's more inviting than its first but just as catchy."" Sean O'Neal of The AV Club said that the album has ""the bland sound of a band trading identity for ambition."" They supported the album with a spring tour across North America that included festival appearances in Bonnaroo and Coachella. On February 8, 2012 the band announced that lead guitarist Jonnie Russell left the band due to personal reasons. 

Dear Miss Lonelyhearts and Hold My Home (2012-present):
On January 2012, the band announced that former Modest Mouse guitarist Dann Gallucci would take Russell's place in the band and premiere on their new single ""Minimum Day"". On January 15, 2013, the band announced a new single, ""Miracle Mile"" for their fourth album, Dear Miss Lonelyhearts. The latter was released on April 2, 2013. They followed that up with a digital-only EP titled Tuxedos, released on September 17, 2013. They promoted both efforts with a US headline tour that ended on November 6, 2013. On November 2013, they announced that a fifth album was in the works. 
On November 10, 2013, the Orange County Register reported that drummer Matt Aveiro had left the band, and that Modest Mouse drummer Joe Plummer would be holding his place indefinitely. Aveiro now drums for a band called Bootstraps out of Los Angeles. 
On March 2014, they collaborated with Belgian brewer company Stella Artois and sonic inventor Andy Cavatorta for a project titled ""Chalice Symphony"", that involved using the brewer's famous drinking glasses as instruments for the band to use to record the track ""A Million Eyes"". The behind-the-scenes videos were used as commercials and were uploaded on the brewer's YouTube page. The song was released on iTunes on March 3, 2014 and the music video that went along with the track premiered on YouTube on April 4, 2014. On May 2014, Willett and Maust worked on a side project with We Barbarians' Nathan Warkentin called French Style Furs. The project's debut album Is Exotic Bait was released on July 8, 2014. The lyrics used on the album were adapted from the poetry of twentieth century Catholic monk and philosopher Thomas Merton, and was recorded with the assistance of Nick Launay. 
On July 15, 2014, the band released the first single, ""All This Could Be Yours"" from their fifth album Hold My Home, which was released on October 21. The release of Hold My Home had drummer Joe Plummer and multi-instrumentalist/singer Matthew Schwartz being credited as proper members of Cold War Kids on the album's liner notes as opposed to touring members as previously credited. 

Musical style and influences:
AllMusic's Heather Phares cites Bob Dylan, Billie Holiday, Jeff Buckley and The Velvet Underground as influences for the band's blues rock-influenced indie rock sound. The band has identified other major influences as Fiona Apple, Nick Cave, Led Zeppelin, Radiohead, The Smiths, U2, and Tom Waits.

The band consists of Jonas Bjerre (vocals), Bo Madsen (guitar), and Silas Utke Graae Jørgensen (drums).  When on tour, Mew is supported by Dr. Nick Watts (Headswim) on keyboard, and Bastian Juel on bass (original bassist Johan Wohlert left in 2006, but returned to the band in 2014). The band's music can be described as experimental pop or as singer Jonas Bjerre mentioned in a recent interview: ""I think that we combine pop music with something that's much more experimental, in our own way. I don't think I would even try and describe it. It's difficult."" Guitarist Bo Madsen has also classified Mew's music as ""indie stadium"".  The members of Mew started playing music together in 1995.  Mew first achieved success in Denmark with their album Frengers, although their debut album, A Triumph for Man, had been met with much critical acclaim back in 1997. At the 2003 Danish Music Critics Award Show, Mew won the awards for ""Album of the Year"" and ""Band of the Year."" Until this point Mew was relatively unknown outside of Denmark; however after a European tour supporting R.E.M. Mew began to attract wider attention. After releasing the critically-acclaimed album And the Glass Handed Kites, featuring contributions from J Mascis from Dinosaur Jr, Mew has built on their success in Denmark as well as attracting attention from the UK. In the summer of 2006, they toured as the supporting act for Bloc Party in the U.S. as well as for Kasabian in the U.S. and Canada in the fall. After these tours, they returned to Denmark to work on new material.    On March 14th, 2007, Mew embarked on their first ever headlining tour in America with Oh No! Oh My! as the supporting act. Their fifth studio album, No More Stories/Are Told Today/I'm Sorry/They Washed Away//No More Stories/The World Is Grey/I'm Tired/Let's Wash Away, was released in August 25, 2009. They've also toured with Nine Inch Nails, Kings of Leon and Sigur Rós. In 2010, they released a greatest hits compilation called Eggs Are Funny. Former bass player Johan Wohlert returned to the band in 2014.

Johan Wohlert left the band in 2006 before the birth of his first child, but made a return in 2013 while the band were in the studio, before making his first live appearances since his departure in 2014. 
Whilst their music may be classified as indie and on occasion progressive rock, the band's guitarist Bo Madsen said ""I usually say we are 'indie stadium.' A mix between 'feelings' and 'thinking' is usually good."" 

History:

Origins (1994-2003):

Formed in 1994 in Hellerup, an upper-class suburb of Copenhagen, they had a profound impact on the Danish indie scene, emerging alongside the likes of Carpark North, Swan Lee and Saybia, amongst others, in 2003. They released their debut album A Triumph for Man in April 1997 and its follow-up Half the World is Watching Me in 2000. At the 2003 Danish Music Critics Award Show, Mew won the awards for ""Album of the Year"" and ""Band of the Year"". 

Frengers (2003-2005):
Their first major commercial success came with Frengers, released in 2003, described as ""a work of quiet brilliance, aiming for the epic without straying into the bombastic, offering cerebral arrangements while keeping things accessible."" The album was well received. After a European tour supporting R.E.M. they began to attract wider attention. 

And the Glass Handed Kites (2005-2009):
Their next album And the Glass Handed Kites was released in Denmark on 19 September 2005, in the United Kingdom and rest of Europe on 26 September, and in the United States on 25 July 2006. The album received critical acclaim, with Mew described as making ""dreamy thunderstorm pop"". They were MTV Asia ""Buzz-Worthy"" as of January, 2006, and at the DMA06 (Danish Music Awards) they took home 4 statuettes. 

On 11 April 2006, Wohlert left the band to spend more time with his girlfriend (now wife), Pernille Rosendahl, of the now-dissolved band Swan Lee, who was to give birth to their son Tristan in May 2006. The two would later go on to form a duo, The Storm. 
The band tours with Nick Watts (formerly of UK indie band Headswim) as their keyboardist, and Bastian Juel (who used to act as a studio and live bassist for Swan Lee and also played bass on Tina Dico's EP Far) joined them as their live bassist. However, he was not an official replacement for Johan and the band returned to the studio with just the three original members for the next album. 
The band finished touring for And the Glass Handed Kites in the summer of 2007. They returned to Brooklyn, New York in May 2008 in order to begin recording their next record, and tapped Rich Costey (who produced their breakthrough album, Frengers) once again as producer. 

No More Stories... (2009-2012):
The band's fifth album No More Stories Are Told Today, I'm Sorry They Washed Away // No More Stories, The World Is Grey, I'm Tired, Let's Wash Away was released on August 17, 2009 in Scandinavia, August 24 in the UK, and August 25 in the US. 
In 2009, the band supported Nine Inch Nails for various tour dates across Europe and the United States. 
On October 25, 2010, Mew released their first compilation album entitled, Eggs Are Funny, which featured 14 songs from previous albums as well as one new song, ""Do You Love It?"". The track list was compiled of what Mew consider to be their ""best work"". 
On an episode of HBO's Eastbound and Down that aired October 31, 2010, ""Comforting Sounds"" from the album Frengers played over the end of the show and into the closing credits. 

+ - (2012-present):
During summer 2012, Mew premiered two new songs, with the working titles ""Boy"" and ""Klassen"", that were in the running to feature on their sixth studio album, at shows in Scandinavia. 
On 23 January 2013, Mew announced via their Facebook page that they were no longer signed to Sony and would release new music independently. On 9 April they confirmed, again via Facebook, that they had started preproduction on their 6th studio album with producer Michael Beinhorn. They commenced the recording of the album on 6 May with producer Michael Beinhorn and engineer Frank Filipetti, who engineered the bass and drums for the album. 
On 25 September, they released an iOS app entitled Sensory Spaces in conjunction with B&O Play. The app contained, amongst other things, a preview of a new song, ""Making Friends"", which will feature on the upcoming album. In November 2013, ""Making Friends (13)"" was made available to stream via Spotify and as a free download via the Sensory Spaces website. The band pointed out that it wasn't a single, but a thank you to their fans for waiting while they completed the upcoming album and that the album would contain a different version of the song. 
On 6 May, guitarist Russell Lissack of the band Bloc Party visited Mew's studio and recorded parts for one or two songs which will feature on the new record. 
During a concert at NorthSide Festival in Aarhus, Denmark on 14 June 2014, Johan Wohlert was formally reintroduced as a member of the band and he played live with the band for the first time since 2006. While the band were onstage, fansite mewx.info posted an article confirming that he had been involved in the writing and recording of the upcoming album. 
On 16 June 2014, Mew announced a Nordic tour for winter 2014, and that the album would be released in 2015. 
As of the Northside show on 14 June 2014, the new songs that have been played live and may be in the running to feature on the new album are tentatively titled ""Making Friends"", ""Klassen"", ""Russle"", which is thought to feature a guitar part by Russell Lissack, ""Witness"", ""Changes"" and ""Boy"". It is unknown what these songs will eventually and officially be titled, and, aside from Making Friends, which of them will feature on the upcoming record. 
On 13 August, they announced via Twitter that they had begun mixing the album. On 19 September, they tweeted that they had finished the upcoming album and that release details would follow soon after. 
The band announced on 19 January 2015 that the sixth album, + -, will be released on 27 April through Play It Again Sam. They also released the first single off the album called ""Satellites"".

In addition to his music career he has also appeared in several films including Steak, directed by longtime friend Mr. Oizo, who appears on Ed Banger label.

Kavinsky claimed that his music is inspired by thousands of movies he watched as a young boy and that he has cherry-picked the best parts from them, consolidating them into one concept. Kavinsky has been compared to many similar French house artists including Daft Punk and Danger and achieved more mainstream notability after his track ""Nightcall"" was featured in the 2011 film Drive. 

Biography:
After many years as an actor, Kavinsky's musical career started in 2005 after being inspired by his close friends Jackson Fourgeaud and Quentin Dupieux, the latter director also included Kavinsky's music in his film Steak. During this period Kavinsky produced his first single ""Testarossa Autodrive"" which was inspired by the Testarossa model of Ferrari (one of which Vincent drives in real life). Kavinsky presented the single to Quentin, who in turn presented it to a record label he had access to because of his filming career, and Kavinsky signed with Record Makers. 
Subsequently Kavinsky went on to release three EPs on the Record Makers label: Teddy Boy in 2006, 1986 a year later, and Nightcall with Lovefoxxx of CSS in 2010. During this period, Kavinsky's fellow producer Surkin jokingly claimed in an interview that Kavinsky was his father and has since toured alongside Daft Punk, The Rapture, Justice, and SebastiAn in 2007. He has also been remixed by SebastiAn and other notable electro artists. 
The SebastiAn remix of ""Testarossa Autodrive"" off the 1986 EP is featured in the video games Grand Theft Auto IV and Gran Turismo 5 Prologue. Kavinsky's single ""Nightcall"" was featured in the opening credits of the film Drive, and became a major hit soon after, with over 40 million YouTube views to date (January 1, 2014). 
In December 2012 he released ""ProtoVision"" and on 25 February 2013 released the studio album OutRun. After a brief hiatus lasting for 9 months, Kavinsky reappeared with the single ""Sovereign"", released in November 2014. 

Character history:
Kavinsky is a character made by Vincent Belorgey that has a striking resemblance to Vincent himself but the backstory does not follow anything in Belorgey's history. Kavinsky's story is that after crashing his Testarossa in 1986, he reappeared as a zombie in 2006 to make his own electronic music. Kavinsky's songs help tell his story; Vincent claims in an interview, ""'Night Call' is just about the zombie guy who goes to his girlfriend's house and says okay I'm not the same, we need to talk"", referring to Kavinsky going back to find his girlfriend after the crash who has already moved on with her life. 

Equipment:
In interview, Kavinsky stated that the entirety of Teddy Boy was written and recorded on a Yamaha DX7, which was famous and notable for the synth-pop sound of the 1980s. Kavinsky originally started making music on an old Apple computer given to him by his friend Mr. Oizo.]",0.471078074866,0.602453,"[filter house, electro house, house, electrofox, alternative dance, new rave, edm]",0.661756,0.00756112353767,0.53148837455,0.332979954644,0.865553059095,0.0307034515821,9.0,0.333679090539,0.921905379132,0.0,0.0539197965414,0.578790422055,4.0,0.436522132894,1

Daft Punk reached significant popularity in the late 90s house movement in France, along with other artists such as Air, Cassius, and Dimitri from Paris. Daft Punk are credited with producing songs that were considered essential in the French house scene. They were managed from 1996 to 2008 by Pedro Winter (Busy P), the head of Ed Banger Records.  The group released four studio albums: Homework (1997), Discovery (2001), Human After All (2005), and Random Access Memories (2013). They also released the soundtrack album TRON: Legacy (2010); the live albums Alive 1997 (2002), Alive 2007 (2007); the compilation Musique Vol. 1 1993-2005 (2006); the remix albums Daft Club (2003), Human After All: Remixes (2006), TRON: Legacy Reconfigured (2011).   Early years (1987-1993)  Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo met in 1987 on the grounds of the Lycée Carnot, a secondary school in Paris. The two became good friends and later recorded demo tracks with others from the school. This eventually led to the formation of the guitar-based group Darlin' with Laurent Brancowitz in 1992. Bangalter and de Homem-Christo played bass and guitar, respectively, while Brancowitz performed on drums. The trio had branded themselves after The Beach Boys song of the same name, which they covered along with an original composition.   Stereolab released both tracks on a multi-artist Duophonic Records EP and invited the band to open for stage shows in the United Kingdom. Bangalter felt that ""The rock n' roll thing we did was pretty average, I think. It was so brief, maybe six months, four songs and two gigs and that was it."" A negative review in Melody Maker subsequently dubbed the music ""a bunch of daft punk."" Instead of dismissing the review, Bangalter and de Homem-Christo found it to be amusing. As the latter stated, ""We struggled so long to find [the name] Darlin', and this happened so quickly."" Darlin' soon disbanded, leaving Brancowitz to pursue other efforts with Phoenix. Bangalter and de Homem-Christo formed Daft Punk and experimented with drum machines and synthesizers.   Homework era (1993-1999)  In 1993 Daft Punk attended a rave at EuroDisney, where they met Stuart Macmillan of Slam, co-founder of the label Soma Quality Recordings. The demo tape given to Macmillan at the rave formed the basis for Daft Punk's debut single, ""The New Wave"", a limited release in 1994. The single also contained the final mix of ""The New Wave"" called ""Alive"".  Daft Punk returned to the studio in May 1995 to record ""Da Funk"". It became their first commercially successful single the same year. After the success of ""Da Funk"", Daft Punk looked to find a manager. They had no trouble finding one at the time as they chose Pedro Winter, who regularly promoted them and other artists at his Hype night clubs. The band signed with Virgin Records in September 1996 and made a deal through which they licensed their tracks to the major label through their production company, Daft Trax.  ""Da Funk"" and ""Alive"" were later included on Daft Punk's 1997 debut album Homework. The album was regarded as an innovative synthesis of techno, house, acid house and electro styles, and is widely acknowledged as one of the most influential dance music albums of the nineties. ""Da Funk"" was also included on The Saint film soundtrack. It was during this period of change in dance music that Daft Punk became largely successful. They combined the aforementioned music styles and elements of rave that were crowd pleasers. The most successful single from Homework was ""Around the World"", which is known for the repeating chant of the song's title.  Daft Punk also produced a series of music videos for Homework directed by Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry, Roman Coppola and Seb Janiak. The collection of videos was released in 1999 and titled D.A.F.T. - A Story about Dogs, Androids, Firemen and Tomatoes.   Discovery era (1999-2004)  By 1999 the duo were well into the recording sessions for their second album, which had begun a year earlier. 2001's Discovery took on a slicker and distinctly synthpop-oriented style, initially stunning fans of Daft Punk's previous material in Homework. The group states that the album was conceived as an attempt to reconnect with a playful, open-minded attitude associated with the discovery phase of childhood. This accounts for the heavy use of themes and samples from the late '70s to early '80s era on the album.  It reached #2 in the United Kingdom, and its single ""One More Time"" was a major club hit, creating a new generation of fans mainly familiar with the second Daft Punk release. The singles ""Digital Love"" and ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"" were also very successful in the UK and on the United States dance chart, and ""Face to Face"" hit #1 on the USA club play charts despite a limited single release. A 45-minute excerpt from a Daftendirektour performance recorded at Birmingham, UK in 1997 was also released in 2001, entitled Alive 1997.  2003 first saw the release of the feature-length animated film Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem. Daft Punk produced the film under the supervision of Leiji Matsumoto, whom they have said is their childhood hero. The album Daft Club was also released to promote the film. It features a collection of remixes previously made available through an online membership service of the same name.   Human After All era (2004-present)  Starting on September 13 and ending November 9, 2004, Daft Punk devoted six weeks to creating new material. The duo released the album Human After All in March 2005. Reviews were mixed, mostly citing its overly repetitive nature and seemingly rushed recording. The singles taken from this album were ""Robot Rock"", ""Technologic"", ""Human After All"" and ""The Prime Time of Your Life"". The earliest official statement from Daft Punk concerning the album was ""we believe that Human After All speaks for itself.""  A Daft Punk anthology CD/DVD entitled Musique Vol. 1 1993-2005 was released on 4 April 2006. It contains new music videos for ""The Prime Time of Your Life"" and ""Robot Rock (Maximum Overdrive)"". Daft Punk also released a remix album of Human After All called Human After All: Remixes. A limited edition included two kubricks of Daft Punk as robots.  On 21 May 2006, Daft Punk premiered their first directed film, Daft Punk's Electroma at the Cannes Film Festival sidebar Director's Fortnight. The film does not include their own music, which is a first for the duo considering their previous DVD and film releases (D.A.F.T. for Homework and Interstella 5555 for Discovery). Midnight screenings of the film were shown in Paris theaters starting from the end of March 2007.  Daft Punk released their second live album titled Alive 2007 on 19 November 2007. It contains the duo's performance in Paris from their Alive 2007 tour. The album includes a 50-page book showcasing photographs shot while on tour. The live version of ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"" from Alive 2007 was released as a single. A music video for the single directed by Olivier Gondry features footage shot by 250 audience members at Daft Punk's Brooklyn appearance at KeySpan Park, Coney Island. In 2007 Daft Punk also debuted in a worldwide official poll of DJ Magazine in position 71.  Following the Alive 2007 tour, Daft Punk focused on other projects. A 2008 interview with Pedro Winter revealed that the duo returned to their Paris studio to work on new material. Winter also stepped down from managing Daft Punk to focus attention on his Ed Banger Records label and his work as Busy P. He stated in a later interview that the duo are working with an unspecified management company in Los Angeles.   Influences  Bangalter and de Homem-Christo have credited many sources that influenced their musical style. Years before producing electronic music as a duo, they were stated to have shared tastes for Elton John, MC5, The Rolling Stones, The Beach Boys and The Stooges. Their mutual admiration for rock bands led to the founding of their own independent project, Darlin'. Bangalter expressed that ""It was still maybe more a teenage thing at that time. It's like, you know, everybody wants to be in a band.""They drew inspiration from the rock and acid house displayed in the United Kingdom during the early 1990s. De Homem-Christo pointed to Screamadelica by Primal Scream as an influential work, as the record ""put everything together"" in terms of genre.  The liner notes of Homework pay tribute to a large number of musical artists and contains a quote from Brian Wilson. Bangalter expressed that ""In Brian Wilson's music you could really feel the beauty - it was very spiritual. Like Bob Marley, too."" When questioned on the success of Daft Punk's debut album and rising popularity of their associated musical genre, Bangalter responded, ""before us you had Frankie Knuckles or Juan Atkins and so on. The least you can do is pay respect to those who are not known and who have influenced people."" The Daft Punk track ""Teachers"" on Homework refers to several influences including Romanthony and Todd Edwards. De Homem-Christo stated that ""Their music had a big effect on us. The sound of their productions -- the compression, the sound of the kick drum and Romanthony's voice, the emotion and soul -- is part of how we sound today.""  Romanthony and Edwards later collaborated with Daft Punk in tracks for Discovery. For the album Daft Punk focused on new styles of electronic music. A major inspiration was the Aphex Twin single ""Windowlicker"", which was ""neither a purely club track nor a very chilled-out, down-tempo relaxation track"" according to Bangalter. The duo also utilized vintage equipment to recreate the sound of a previous artist. As stated by de Homem-Christo, ""On 'Digital Love' you get this Supertramp vibe on the bridge,"" which was generated through an in-studio Wurlitzer piano. During a later interview, de Homem-Christo clarified that ""we didn't make a list of artists we like and copy their songs.""   Visual components  Daft Punk are noted for their use of visual components associated with their musical productions. The music videos for their singles from Homework featured memorable characters and placed emphasis on storytelling instead of musical performance. The album Discovery subsequently became the soundtrack to Interstella 5555.  Their outward personae have also changed over time. During their Homework years, the duo would usually wear masks to hide their appearance. When not wearing disguises, they occasionally preferred to be replaced by animation (as they appeared in The Work of Director Michel Gondry DVD) or have their faces digitally obscured for press kits. Very few photos of the duo's faces exist, including a blurry one found in the Homework liner notes.  In their more visible Discovery years, they have appeared as futuristic robots for publicity photo shoots, interviews, live shows and music videos. These suits, engineered by Tony Gardner and Alterian, Inc., sport complicated helmets capable of various LED effects and metallic finger gloves. Daft Punk introduced the costumes to many U.S. television viewers through an advertisement for a special presentation of their videos during Cartoon Network's Toonami block. Thomas Bangalter once stated, ""We did not choose to become robots. There was an accident in our studio. We were working on our sampler, and at exactly 9:09 a.m. on September 9, 1999, it exploded. When we regained consciousness, we discovered that we had become robots.""  During a video interview shot in Japan, Daft Punk stated that they donned their robot masks to easily merge the characteristics of humans and machines. However, Bangalter later admitted that the costumes were initially the result of shyness. ""But then it became exciting from the audiences' point of view. It's the idea of being an average guy with some kind of superpower."" When asked on whether the duo expressed themselves differently within the robotic suits, Bangalter stated ""No, we don't need to. It's not about having inhibitions. It's more like an advanced version of glam, where it's definitely not you."" With the release of Human After All, the musical duo's outfits became slightly less complicated by consisting of dark leather jumpsuits and simplified versions of the Discovery head gear. The jumpsuits were designed by Hedi Slimane.  During the filming and promotion of Daft Punk's Electroma, the duo went to great lengths to avoid showing their faces. While on the set of the film, the duo chose to be interviewed with their backs turned. As reported on October 2006, the band went as far as to wear black cloth over their heads during a televised interview.  It is believed that the mystery of their identity and the elaborate nature of their disguises has added to their popularity. The iconic status of the robotic costumes has been compared to the makeup of Kiss and the leather jacket worn by Iggy Pop. Bangalter stated, ""The mask gets very hot, but after wearing it as long as I have, I am used to it.""   Live performances  In the mid-to-late nineties, Daft Punk performed live without costumes in many places including the United States. In particular, a rare bootlegged video featuring the duo in Wisconsin matches the verified identity of Thomas Bangalter. Less clearly seen, Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo is to Bangalter's right and is mostly cut off from the camera. Comparing the artwork packaging of Homework to the video footage, one can verify that the album's liner note photo was taken during this event.  In the fall of 1997 they did their Daftendirektour to promote Homework in several cities throughout the world. For this tour Daft Punk opted to utilize their home studio equipment for the live stage instead of creating a more conventional DJ set. As Bangalter stated, ""Everything was synched up -- the drum machines, the bass lines. The sequencer was just sending out the tempos and controlling the beats and bars. On top of this structure we built all these layers of samples and various parts that we could bring in whenever we wanted to."" 25 May 1997 saw them perform at the Tribal Gathering festival at Luton Hoo, England, headlining with Orbital and Kraftwerk. Also of note is the November 8 performance in Birmingham, UK, from which came the recording of Alive 1997.  At the start of 2006, Daft Punk announced plans for a number of special summer shows. On 29 April Daft Punk performed at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival where they received a jubilant reception for their first U.S. performance since 1997. Thomas Bangalter had initially been reported as saying that there would be a DVD of their recent live set. He later emphasized his reluctance for such a release, as the duo felt that online amateur videos of their performances were more compelling than anything captured professionally. In an interview with the Miami Herald Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo stated that their November 11 appearance at the Bang Music Festival was their final for 2006 and that Daft Punk would conduct more performances in the future. The band later specified a date for a live show at Bercy, Paris for June 2007. Also reported were dates at the Rock Ness Festival and Wireless Festival in June, the Oxegen festival in July and Lollapalooza in August. Daft Punk then announced a world tour called Alive 2007.  Daft Punk played at the Rock Ness Festival by the banks of Loch Ness, Scotland on 10 June 2007 as the headline act in the 10,000 capacity Clash tent. To the crowds displeasure, the show was delayed, but the crowd gave the duo a jubilant welcome when they appeared. Due to popularity, part of the tent was removed to allow thousands of people outside to see the show. On 16 June 2007 Daft Punk successfully headlined the third day of the O2 Wireless Festival to positive reaction and reviews. The Times described the set as a ""memorable sensory spectacle, both dazzling and deafening"" and ThisisLondon declared it ""an almost faultless set of relentless electro euphoria"".  Daft Punk headlined Stage 2/NME Stage at the Oxegen music festival on 8 July 2007. Their live set was preceded by a showing of the trailer for the film Daft Punk's Electroma. Subsequent reports stated that the Daft Punk appearance was the highlight of the festival. NME expressed that the performance was ""a robotic spectacular"", while Shoutmouth described the set as ""typically triumphant"". Four days later, the duo played at Traffic Torino Free Festival in Parco della Pellerina in Turin, Italy.  Daft Punk headlined the AT&T stage on 3 August 2007, the first night of the Lollapalooza music festival in Chicago. Their show there was praised by Pitchfork Media stating that the experience of watching the performance ""was a much-needed reminder of the still-potent power of communicative pop."" On August 9 they performed at KeySpan Park in Brooklyn, New York.  Daft Punk composed the music for the Louis Vuitton Spring/Summer 2008 Womenswear Full Show on 7 October 2007. The duo also headlined the Vegoose festival in Las Vegas on 27 October. They appeared at the festival along with bands Rage Against the Machine, Muse and Queens of the Stone Age. At the end of the month, Daft Punk performed in Mexico City. The duo also performed on Friday November 2, 2007 at the Arena Monterrey in Monterrey, Mexico.  Modular announced that Daft Punk would appear in Australia for an event in December 2007 called Never Ever Land. The announcement addressed years of speculation on whether Daft Punk would visit Australia for live performances. Never Ever Land included Australian acts The Presets, Cut Copy, Muscles, Van She and the Bang Gang Deejays. Daft Punk were supported by their regular acts Sebastian and Kavinsky at the appearances, which had been announced as an extension to the Alive 2007 tour. Never Ever Land toured to Melbourne at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl, Perth at the Esplanade, Brisbane at the Riverstage and finally Sydney at the Sydney Showground Main Arena. A Triple J interview with Pedro Winter (Busy P) revealed that Daft Punk's Sydney appearance on December 22 would be their final show for 2007 and the last to feature the pyramid light scheme. Tickets for the Australian tour sold more quickly than for any Daft Punk-related event in their history. The duo stated in an EMI-sponsored live webchat that there will be no tour performances for 2008, and that they would instead focus on new projects.  Daft Punk made a surprise appearance at the 50th Grammy Awards on February 10, 2008. The duo appeared with Kanye West to perform a reworked version of ""Stronger"" on stage at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. For the appearance, Daft Punk utilized four JazzMutant Lemur controllers. A press release specified that this was the first televised live performance by the duo in their career. Bangalter's wife, Élodie Bouchez, also attended the event.  Following the Alive 2007 tour, Daft Punk focused on other projects. A 2008 interview with Pedro Winter revealed that the duo returned to their Paris studio to work on new material. Winter also stepped down from managing Daft Punk to focus attention on his Ed Banger Records label and his work as Busy P. He stated in a later interview that the duo are working with an unspecified management company in Los Angeles. In 2008, Daft Punk placed 38th in a worldwide official poll of DJ Magazine after debuting at position 71 in the year before. On 8 February 2009, Daft Punk won Grammy Awards for Alive 2007 and its single ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"".   Daft Punk in DJ Hero Daft Punk provided eleven new mixes featuring their music for the video game DJ Hero. They also appear in the game as playable characters, along with their own venue. The duo appear wearing their Discovery-era helmets and Human After All-era leather attire. Daft Punk's playable likenesses are absent from the sequel DJ Hero 2, which includes a remixed version of their song ""Human After All"".  At the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con, it was announced that the duo composed 24 tracks for the film Tron: Legacy. Daft Punk's score was arranged and orchestrated by Joseph Trapanese. The band collaborated with him for two years on the score, from pre-production to completion. The score features an 85-piece orchestra, recorded at AIR Lyndhurst Studios in London. Joseph Kosinski, director of the film, referred to the score as being a mixture of orchestral and electronic elements.  Daft Punk also make a cameo appearance as disc jockey programs wearing their trademark robot masks within the film's virtual world. Tron: Legacy co-star Olivia Wilde stated that the duo may be involved with future promotional events related to the film. A teaser trailer features Daft Punk and their track ""Derezzed"" from Tron: Legacy. The soundtrack album of the film was released on 6 December 2010. A deluxe 2-disc edition of the album was also released that includes a poster of the duo from the film. Additional bonus tracks are also available through various online vendors. An official music video for ""Derezzed"", with a running time of less than two minutes, also premiered on the MTV Networks on the same day the album was released. The video, which features Olivia Wilde as Quorra in specially shot footage, along with images of Daft Punk in Flynn's Arcade, was later made available for purchase from the iTunes Store and included in the DVD and Blu-ray releases of the film. Walt Disney Records released a remix album of the score titled Tron: Legacy Reconfigured on 5 April 2011.  In 2010 Daft Punk were admitted into the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, an order of merit of France. Bangalter and de Homem-Christo were individually awarded the rank of Chevalier (knight). Soma Records released a previously unpublished Daft Punk track called ""Drive"" that was made during the same time the duo was still with Soma Records and recording ""Rollin' and Scratchin'"" and ""Da Funk"". The track was included in a 20th anniversary multi-artist compilation of the Soma label. In October 2011, Daft Punk placed 28th in a worldwide official poll of DJ Magazine after appearing at position 44 in the year before. On 19 January 2012, Daft Punk ranked No. 2 on Mixmag's Greatest Dance Acts of All Time, with The Prodigy at No. 1 by just a few points.  In October 2012, Daft Punk provided a fifteen-minute mix of songs by blues musician Junior Kimbrough for Hedi Slimane's Yves Saint Laurent fashion show.[40] The duo also placed 44th in DJ Magazine's annual Top 100 DJs list.  Daft Punk is currently working on their forthcoming album in collaboration with singer-songwriter Paul Williams and Chic frontman Nile Rodgers. Williams mentioned the collaboration in two separate interviews, and that the project has been in production since 2010. During an interview with Rodgers, he stated that he would meet with Daft Punk to discuss the duo's upcoming album. Rodgers later said that he and Daft Punk had an informal jam session when they met, and that a formal collaboration would be undertaken. Although Williams stated that Daft Punk's new album could be released as early as June 2012, it was later confirmed that this would not be the case.  In May 2012 it was announced that Giorgio Moroder had collaborated with the duo, recording a monologue about his life in a vocal booth containing microphones ranging from the 1960s to present day. When asked, the engineer responded that each mic was used to represent the different decades of Moroder's life in his monologue. Rodgers was also present during the recording session. Chilly Gonzales stated in an interview that he had performed material for the duo's project in a one-day session: ""I played for hours and they're gonna grab what they grab and turn it into whatever."" He also said that the album would be released ""next spring"".  In an interview conducted on 28 November 2012 with Fourplay member Nathan East, he said to have collaborated with the duo on the project. In this interview, it is also implied that the album will be available in CD format. On 4 January 2013, Nile Rodgers talked about his number of collaborations to be released in 2013 on his blog, and also stated ""The next time [he sets] foot in Japan, [his] collaboration with Daft Punk would have started to hit people's eardrums"".   http://www.daftpunk.com http://www.daftalive.com, ..Daft Punk - HARDER BETTER FASTER STRONGER (Alive 2007)...... .. ..., In similar company with new-school French progressive dance artists such ..., French 1990s neo-disco duo Daft Punk found stardom as a ..., In similar company with new-school French progressive dance artists such ..., Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo met on the grounds ..., In similar company with French progressive dance artists such as ..., Evolving from French house pioneers in the '90s to 2000s ..., From Daft Punk’s first single release in 1993, Guy-Manuel de ..., Daft Punk is an electronic music duo consisting of French musicians Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter. Daft Punk reached significant popularity in the late 1990s house movement in France and met with continued success in the years following, combining elements of house with synthpop. The duo's songs are considered essential in the French house scene. The group was managed from 1996 to 2008 by Pedro Winter (Busy P), the head of Ed Banger Records. Early in the group's career, the band members were influenced by groups including The Beach Boys and The Rolling Stones. 
Bangalter and de Homem-Christo were originally in a band called Darlin', which disbanded after a short period of time, leaving the two to experiment musically on their own. The duo became Daft Punk, releasing its debut album Homework in 1997 to highly positive reviews. The 2001 release of Discovery was even more successful, driven by the club singles ""One More Time"", ""Digital Love"", and ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"". In March 2005, the duo released the album Human After All to mixed reviews. However, the singles ""Robot Rock"" and ""Technologic"" achieved success in the United Kingdom. 
Daft Punk toured throughout 2006 and 2007 and released the live album Alive 2007, which won a Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album. The duo composed the score of the film Tron: Legacy and in 2010 released the soundtrack album of the film. In January 2013, Daft Punk left EMI Records for Sony Music Entertainment's subsidiary label Columbia, and released Random Access Memories in 2013 to worldwide critical acclaim. The lead single ""Get Lucky"" became an international success, peaking in the top 10 in 32 countries. Random Access Memories led to five Grammy wins in 2014 including Album of the Year, as well as Record of the Year for ""Get Lucky"". 
The group is known for emphasising using visual and story components associated with their musical productions, and for using disguises while in public and/or performing; specifically ornate helmets and gloves to assume robot personas in most of their public appearances since 2001. The duo rarely grant interviews or appear on television. 

History:

1987-1993: Early years:
Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo met in 1987 while attending the Lycée Carnot, a secondary school in Paris. The two became good friends and later recorded demo tracks with others from the school. This eventually led to the formation of the guitar-based group called Darlin' with Laurent Brancowitz in 1992. Bangalter and de Homem-Christo played bass and guitar, respectively, while Brancowitz performed on drums. The trio had branded themselves after The Beach Boys song of the same name, which they covered along with an original composition.Stereolab released both tracks on a multi-artist Duophonic Records EP and invited the band to open for stage shows in the United Kingdom. Bangalter felt that ""The rock n' roll thing we did was pretty average, I think. It was so brief, maybe six months, four songs and two gigs and that was it."" A negative review in Melody Maker by Dave Jennings subsequently dubbed the music ""a daft punky thrash."" Instead of dismissing the review, they found it amusing. As de Homem-Christo stated, ""We struggled so long to find the name Darlin', and this happened so quickly."" Darlin' soon disbanded, leaving Brancowitz to pursue other efforts with Phoenix. Bangalter and de Homem-Christo formed Daft Punk and experimented with drum machines and synthesizers. 

1993-1999: Homework:

In September 1993, Daft Punk attended a rave at EuroDisney, where they met Stuart Macmillan of Slam, co-founder of the label Soma Quality Recordings. The demo tape given to Macmillan at the rave formed the basis for Daft Punk's debut single, ""The New Wave"", a limited release in 1994. The single also contained the final mix of ""The New Wave"" called ""Alive"", which was to be featured on Daft Punk's first album. 
Daft Punk returned to the studio in May 1995 to record ""Da Funk"". It became the duo's first commercially successful single the same year. After the success of ""Da Funk"", Daft Punk looked to find a manager. The duo eventually settled on Pedro Winter, who regularly promoted it and other artists at his Hype night clubs. The band signed with Virgin Records in September 1996 and made a deal through which the duo licensed its tracks to the major label through its production company, Daft Trax. Bangalter spoke of the duo's decision to sign with Virgin: 
"" 
Many record companies offered us deals. They came from everywhere, but we decided to wait--partly because we didn't want to lose control of what we had created. We turned down many record companies. We weren't interested in the money, so we turned down labels that were looking for more control than we were willing to give up. In reality, we're more like partners with Virgin. 
"" 
 With regard to the artistic control and freedom, Bangalter stated: 
"" 
We've got much more control than money. You can't get everything. We live in a society where money is what people want, so they can't get the control. We chose. Control is freedom. People say we're control freaks, but control is controlling your destiny without controlling other people. We're not trying to manipulate other people, just controlling what we do ourselves. Controlling what we do is being free. People should stop thinking that an artist that controls what he does is a bad thing. A lot of artists today are just victims, not having control, and they're not free. And that's pathetic. If you start being dependent on money, then money has to reach a point to fit your expenses. 
"" 
 ""Da Funk"" and ""Alive"" were later included on Daft Punk's 1997 debut album Homework. In February of that year, the UK dance magazine Muzik published a Daft Punk cover feature and described Homework as ""one of the most hyped debut albums in a long long time."" According to The Village Voice, the album revived house music and departed from the Eurodance formula. As noted by critic Alex Rayner, Homework brought together established club styles and the ""burgeoning eclecticism"" of big beat. The most successful single from Homework was ""Around the World"", which is known for the repeating chant of the song's title. ""Da Funk"" was also included on The Saint film soundtrack. Daft Punk produced a series of music videos for Homework directed by Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry, Roman Coppola and Seb Janiak. The collection of videos was released in 1999 and titled D.A.F.T.: A Story About Dogs, Androids, Firemen and Tomatoes. 

1999-2004: Discovery:
By 1999, the duo was well into the recording sessions for its second album, which had begun a year earlier. The 2001 release of Discovery took on a slicker and distinctly synthpop-oriented style, initially stunning fans of Daft Punk's previous material in Homework. The group states that the album was conceived as an attempt to reconnect with a playful, open-minded attitude associated with the discovery phase of childhood. This accounts for the heavy use of themes and samples from the late '70s to early '80s era on the album. The album reached No. 2 in the United Kingdom, and its single, ""One More Time"", was a major club and mainstream hit that nearly topped the UK Singles Chart. The song is well known for being heavily Auto-Tuned and compressed. The song and album created a new generation of fans mainly familiar with the second Daft Punk release. The singles ""Digital Love"" and ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"" were also very successful in the UK and on the United States dance chart. ""Digital Love"" was subsequently covered by the bands Kodaline and Hellogoodbye. The song ""Face to Face"" hit No. 1 on the USA club play charts despite a limited single release. A 45-minute excerpt from a Daftendirektour performance recorded at Birmingham, UK in 1997 was also released in 2001, titled Alive 1997. The year 2003 saw the release of the feature-length animated film, Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem. Daft Punk produced the film under the supervision of Leiji Matsumoto, who is their childhood hero. The album Daft Club was also released to promote the film. It features a collection of remixes previously made available through an online membership service of the same name. 

2004-2008: Human After All:

Starting on 13 September and ending on 9 November 2004, Daft Punk devoted six weeks to the creation of new material. The duo released the album Human After All in March 2005. Reviews were mixed, mostly citing its overly repetitive nature and seemingly rushed recording. The singles taken from this album were ""Robot Rock"", ""Technologic"", ""Human After All"", and ""The Prime Time of Your Life"". The earliest official statement from Daft Punk concerning the album was ""we believe that Human After All speaks for itself."" 
A Daft Punk anthology CD/DVD titled Musique Vol. 1 1993-2005 was released on 4 April 2006. It contains music videos for ""Robot Rock (Maximum Overdrive)"" and ""The Prime Time of Your Life"" directed by Daft Punk and Tony Gardner, respectively. Daft Punk also released a remix album of Human After All called Human After All: Remixes. A limited edition included two kubricks of Daft Punk as robots. 
On 21 May 2006, Daft Punk premiered its first directed film, Daft Punk's Electroma, at the Cannes Film Festival sidebar Director's Fortnight. The film does not include Daft Punk's own music, which is a first for the duo considering its previous DVD and film releases (D.A.F.T. for Homework and Interstella 5555 for Discovery). Midnight screenings of the film were shown in Paris theaters starting from the end of March 2007. Initial public comments have since been positive. 
Daft Punk released its second live album titled Alive 2007 on 19 November 2007. It contains the duo's performance in Paris from its Alive 2007 tour. The live version of ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"" from Alive 2007 was released as a single. Olivier Gondry directed a music video for the single that features footage shot by 250 audience members at Daft Punk's Brooklyn appearance at KeySpan Park, Coney Island. 

2008-2011: Tron: Legacy:

Following the Alive 2007 tour, the duo focused on other projects. A 2008 interview with Pedro Winter revealed that Daft Punk returned to its Paris studio to work on new material. Winter also stepped down from managing the duo to focus attention on his Ed Banger Records label and his work as Busy P. He stated in a later interview that Daft Punk is working with an unspecified management company in Los Angeles. The duo held its Daft Arts production office at the Jim Henson Studios complex in Hollywood. In 2008, Daft Punk placed 38th in a worldwide official poll of DJ Magazine after debuting at position 71 in the year before. On 8 February 2009, Daft Punk won Grammy Awards for Alive 2007 and its single ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"". Janet Jackson's song ""So Much Betta"" from her 2008 album Discipline features a sample of Daft Punk's song ""Daftendirekt"". 
Daft Punk provided eleven new mixes featuring its music for the video game DJ Hero. The duo also appears in the game as a pair of playable characters, along with a unique venue. The duo appears wearing its Discovery-era helmets and Human After All-era leather attire. Daft Punk's playable likenesses are absent from the sequel DJ Hero 2, which includes a remixed version of the song ""Human After All"". 
At the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con, it was announced that the duo composed 24 tracks for the film Tron: Legacy. Daft Punk's score was arranged and orchestrated by Joseph Trapanese. The band collaborated with him for two years on the score, from pre-production to completion. The score features an 85-piece orchestra, recorded at AIR Lyndhurst Studios in London.Joseph Kosinski, director of the film, referred to the score as being a mixture of orchestral and electronic elements. The members of Daft Punk also make a cameo appearance as disc jockey programs wearing their trademark robot helmets within the film's virtual world. Tron: Legacy co-star Olivia Wilde stated that the duo may be involved with future promotional events related to the film. A teaser trailer features Daft Punk and their track ""Derezzed"" from Tron: Legacy. The soundtrack album of the film was released on 6 December 2010. A deluxe 2-disc edition of the album was also released that includes a poster of the duo from the film. Additional bonus tracks are also available through various online vendors. An official music video for ""Derezzed"", with a running time of less than two minutes, also premiered on the MTV Networks on the same day the album was released. The video, which features Olivia Wilde as Quorra in specially shot footage, along with images of Daft Punk in Flynn's Arcade, was later made available for purchase from the iTunes Store and included in the DVD and Blu-ray releases of the film. Walt Disney Records released a remix album of the score titled Tron: Legacy Reconfigured on 5 April 2011. 
In 2010 Daft Punk were admitted into the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, an order of merit of France. Bangalter and de Homem-Christo were individually awarded the rank of Chevalier (knight). 

2011-present: Random Access Memories:
Soma Records released a previously unpublished Daft Punk track called ""Drive"" that was made while the duo was still with Soma Records and recording ""Rollin' and Scratchin'"" and ""Da Funk"". The track was included in a twentieth anniversary multi-artist compilation of the Soma label. In October 2011, Daft Punk placed 28th in a ""top-100 DJs of 2011"" list by DJ Magazine after appearing at position 44 in the year before. On 19 January 2012, Daft Punk ranked No. 2 on Mixmag's Greatest Dance Acts of All Time, with The Prodigy at No. 1 by just a few points. 
Daft Punk worked on their fourth studio album, Random Access Memories in collaboration with singer-songwriter Paul Williams and Chic frontman Nile Rodgers. In May 2012 it was also announced that Italian musician Giorgio Moroder had collaborated with the duo, recording a monologue about his life in a vocal booth containing microphones ranging from 1960 to present day.Chilly Gonzales stated in an interview that he had performed material for the duo's project in a one-day session: ""I played for hours and they're gonna grab what they grab and turn it into whatever."" He also said that the album would be released ""next spring"".Fourplay member Nathan East later mentioned that he had contributed to the project. 
In October 2012, Daft Punk provided a fifteen-minute mix of songs by blues musician Junior Kimbrough for Hedi Slimane's Yves Saint Laurent fashion show. The duo also placed 44th in DJ Magazine's annual Top 100 DJs list. 
In January 2013, de Homem-Christo revealed that Daft Punk was in the process of signing with Sony Music Entertainment through the Columbia Records label, and that the album would have a spring release. A gradual promotional rollout was later launched featuring billboards and television spots, leading to the reveal of the album title and the release date of 21 May 2013. On 3 April, the official Random Access Memories website launched The Collaborators, a series of 16mm documentary videos about the album. Later that month, a video preview for the song ""Get Lucky"" featuring Rodgers and Pharrell Williams was played at the 2013 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. The radio edit of the song was released as a digital download single one week later on 19 April 2013. ""Get Lucky"" became Daft Punk's first UK No. 1 single on 28 April 2013 remaining at number one for 4 weeks (as of 24 May) and the Spotify music streaming website reported that the song is the most-streamed new song in the service's history. At the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, Daft Punk debuted a trailer for their single ""Lose Yourself to Dance,"" and presented the award for ""Best Female Video"" alongside Rodgers and Pharrell. 
For the 56th Annual Grammy Awards, Random Access Memories was awarded the Grammy for Best Dance/Electronica Album, Album of the Year and Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical, while ""Get Lucky"" received the Grammy for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance and the Record of the Year. Daft Punk also performed a medley at the ceremony with Rodgers, Pharrell, and Stevie Wonder of ""Get Lucky"", ""Le Freak"", ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"", ""Another Star"", ""Lose Yourself to Dance"", and ""Around the World"". Pharrell later released his second studio album G I R L, in which Daft Punk performed additional vocals for the song ""Gust of Wind"". 
On 10 March 2014, an unreleased Daft Punk song called ""Computerized"" surfaced on the Internet. The song features Jay-Z and appears to contain elements of ""The Son of Flynn"" from the Tron: Legacy soundtrack. 
In April 2015, Daft Punk appeared in a short tribute to Nile Rodgers as part of a documentary on Rodgers' life titled ""Nile Rodgers: From Disco to Daft Punk"". In the short clip, the two send a ""transmission"" to Rodgers with the message, ""DEAR NILE WE ARE SENDING YOU THIS TRANSMISSION TO THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR AMAZING SONGS. YOUR MUSIC CONTINUES TO INSPIRE THE WORLD... WITH LOVE, DAFT PUNK"". 

Influences:
Bangalter and de Homem-Christo have credited many sources that influenced their musical style. Years before producing electronic music as a duo, they shared tastes for Elton John, MC5, The Rolling Stones, The Beach Boys and The Stooges. Bangalter recalled that the records motivated him to learn English as a second language, since he wanted to understand the lyrics. The duo's mutual admiration for rock bands led to the founding of their own indie group called Darlin'. Bangalter explained: ""It was still maybe more a teenage thing at that time. It's like, you know, everybody wants to be in a band."" They also drew inspiration from the rock and acid house in the United Kingdom during the early 1990s. De Homem-Christo referred to Screamadelica by Primal Scream as the record that ""put everything together"" in terms of genre"". 
The liner notes of Homework pay tribute to a large number of musical artists and contain a quote from Brian Wilson. Bangalter stated: ""In Brian Wilson's music you could really feel the beauty--it was very spiritual. Like Bob Marley, too."" When questioned on the success of Daft Punk's debut album and the rising popularity of their associated musical genre, Bangalter responded, ""before us you had Frankie Knuckles or Juan Atkins and so on. The least you can do is pay respect to those who are not known and who have influenced people."" The Daft Punk track ""Teachers"", from Homework, refers to several influences, such as Romanthony and Todd Edwards. De Homem-Christo stated: ""Their music had a big effect on us. The sound of their productions--the compression, the sound of the kick drum and Romanthony's voice, the emotion and soul--is part of how we sound today."" A 2011 Bodytonic podcast featured tracks from all of the artists named in ""Teachers"", the Brian Wilson speech quoted in the liner notes of Homework, and a Kraftwerk-like 1983 track produced by Daniel Vangarde, father of Bangalter. 
Romanthony and Edwards later collaborated with Daft Punk on tracks for Discovery. For the album, Daft Punk focused on new styles of electronic music. A major inspiration was the Aphex Twin single ""Windowlicker"", which was ""neither a purely club track nor a very chilled-out, down-tempo relaxation track"", according to Bangalter. The duo also utilized vintage equipment to recreate the sound of an artist from a previous era. As stated by de Homem-Christo, ""On 'Digital Love' you get this Supertramp vibe on the bridge,"" which was generated through an in-studio Wurlitzer piano. During a later interview, de Homem-Christo clarified that ""we didn't make a list of artists we like and copy their songs."" Daft Punk would collaborate with Edwards again on the song ""Fragments of Time"", featured on the 2013 album Random Access Memories. 
During a 2009 interview, Bangalter named Andy Warhol as one of Daft Punk's early artistic influences. For the Tron: Legacy soundtrack, the duo drew inspiration from Wendy Carlos, the composer of the original Tron film, as well as Max Steiner, Bernard Herrmann, John Carpenter, Vangelis, Philip Glass and Maurice Jarre. Daft Punk later sought a ""west coast vibe"" during the production of Random Access Memories, referencing such bands as Fleetwood Mac, The Doobie Brothers and the Eagles. They also highlighted the influence of Jean Michel Jarre in an interview following the album's release. 

Visual components and image:

Daft Punk are noted for their use of visual components associated with their musical productions. The music videos for their singles from Homework featured distinctive characters and placed emphasis on storytelling instead of musical performance. The album Discovery subsequently became the soundtrack to Interstella 5555. 
Their outward personas have also changed over time. In one of the duo's earliest magazine appearances, de Homem-Christo stated in a Jockey Slut interview that, ""We don't want to be photographed. ... We don't especially want to be in magazines. We have a responsibility."" Although they allowed a camera crew to film them for a French television arts program at the time, Daft Punk did not wish to speak on screen ""because it is dangerous."" During their Homework years, the duo would usually wear masks to hide their appearance. When not wearing disguises, they occasionally preferred to be replaced by animation (as they appeared in The Work of Director Michel Gondry DVD) or have their faces digitally obscured for press kits. Few official photos of the duo's faces exist, including a blurry one found in the Homework liner notes. 
In their more visible Discovery years, they appeared wearing robotic headgear and metallic gloves for publicity photo shoots, interviews, live shows and music videos. The helmets were produced by Paul Hahn of Daft Arts and the French directors Alex and Martin, the duo who also designed them. With engineering by Tony Gardner and Alterian, Inc., they are capable of various LED effects. Wigs were originally attached to both helmets, but the duo removed them just before the outfits were publicly unveiled in 2001. Daft Punk introduced the costumes to many U.S. television viewers through an advertisement for a special presentation of their videos during Cartoon Network's Toonami block. Thomas Bangalter once stated, ""We did not choose to become robots. There was an accident in our studio. We were working on our sampler, and at exactly 9:09 am on September 9, 1999, it exploded. When we regained consciousness, we discovered that we had become robots."" 
Daft Punk have said that they donned their robot outfits to easily merge the characteristics of humans and machines. However, Bangalter later stated that the costumes were initially the result of shyness. ""But then it became exciting from the audience's point of view. It's the idea of being an average guy with some kind of superpower."" When asked whether the duo expressed themselves differently within the robotic suits, Bangalter stated ""No, we don't need to. It's not about having inhibitions. It's more like an advanced version of glam, where it's definitely not you."" With the release of Human After All, the musical duo's outfits became slightly less complicated by consisting of black leather jacket and pants and simplified versions of the Discovery headgear. The attire was designed by Hedi Slimane. Bangalter stated that, ""We never like to do the same thing twice. It's more fun and entertaining for us to do something different, whether it's wearing masks or developing a persona that merges fiction and reality. We're happy to give back to the masses"". 
According to Bangalter, the duo has a ""general rule about not appearing in videos."" Although Daft Punk rarely grants interviews, Bangalter is cited as being the more talkative and opinionated one of the duo. With regard to fame and stardom, he said: 
"" 
We don't believe in the star system. We want the focus to be on the music. If we have to create an image, it must be an artificial image. That combination hides our physicality and also shows our view of the star system. It is not a compromise.We're trying to separate the private side and the public side. It's just that we're a little bit embarrassed by the whole thing. We don't want to play this star system thing. We don't want to get recognised in the streets. Yes. Everyone has accepted us using masks in photos so far, which makes us happy. Maybe sometimes people are a little bit disappointed but that's the only way we want to do it. We think the music is the most personal thing we can give. The rest is just about people taking themselves seriously, which is all very boring sometimes. 

"" 
 In the same interview, he was also asked a question if stardom can be avoided. 
"" 
Yes. I think people understand what we are doing. I know many people who maybe like the way we are handling things. People understand that you don't need to be on the covers of magazines with your face to make good music. Painters or other artists, you don't know them but you know what they are doing. We are very happy that the concept in itself is becoming famous. In France, you speak of Daft Punk and I'm sure millions of people have heard it, but less than a few thousand people know our face--which is the thing we're into. We control it, but it's not us physically, our persons. We don't want to run into people who are the same age as us, shaking our hand and saying, 'Can I have your autograph?' because we think we're exactly like them. Even girls, they can fall in love with your music, but not with you. You don't always have to compromise yourself to be successful. The playing with masks is just to make it funnier. Pictures can be boring. We don't want all the rock n' roll poses and attitudes--they are completely stupid and ridiculous today. 
"" 

During the filming and promotion of Daft Punk's Electroma, the duo went to great lengths to avoid showing their faces. While on the set of the film, the duo chose to be interviewed with their backs turned. As reported on October 2006, the band went as far as to wear black cloth over their heads during a televised interview. During this interview they noted that the use of cloth bags in particular had been a spontaneous decision, reflecting their willingness to experiment with their perceived image in the media. 
It is believed that the mystery of their identity and the elaborate nature of their disguises have added to their popularity. The iconic status of the robotic costumes has been compared to the makeup of KISS and the leather jacket worn by Iggy Pop. 
Bangalter has noted, ""The mask gets very hot, but after wearing it as long as I have, I am used to it."" He later stated that the helmets in their current iteration are fitted with ventilators to prevent overheating. 

Live performances:

In the mid-to-late nineties, Daft Punk performed live without costumes in many places including the United States. In 1996, the duo were featured at an Even Furthur event in Wisconsin, their first public performance in the U.S. In addition to live original performances, they performed a number of times in various clubs using vinyl records from their collection. They were known for incorporating various styles of music into their DJ sets at that time. 
In 1997 they did their Daftendirektour to promote Homework in several cities throughout the world. For this tour Daft Punk opted to utilize their home studio equipment for the live stage. As Bangalter stated, ""Everything was synched up--the drum machines, the bass lines. The sequencer was just sending out the tempos and controlling the beats and bars. On top of this structure we built all these layers of samples and various parts that we could bring in whenever we wanted to."" 25 May 1997 saw them perform at the Tribal Gathering festival at Luton Hoo, England, headlining with Orbital and Kraftwerk. Also of note is the performance of 8 November in Birmingham, UK, from which came the recording of Alive 1997. 
The Alive 2006/2007 tour began with a sole United States performance at the Coachella Festival in Indio, California in May 2006. Several festival appearances in Europe followed throughout the summer. Two consecutive performances also took place at the Summer Sonic Festival in Japan, held in Osaka and Chiba City respectively. Daft Punk's final performance of the year occurred in the autumn, when they visited South America and played their second U.S. performance at the Bang! Music Festival in Miami, Florida. 
In June 2007, the duo resumed touring, beginning with an appearance at the RockNess music festival in the United Kingdom. After further shows and festival performances in Europe, the act returned to North America for a full-fledged eight date tour. This reached many markets for the first time on the trek and included a headline festival slot at Lollapalooza in Chicago. A second leg of shows in October followed, consisting of an appearance at the Vegoose music festival in Las Vegas, Nevada and three shows in Mexico. In December 2007, the duo returned to Japan to play a trio of dates. This was followed by a series of special shows in Australia, dubbed ""Never Ever Land"". The dates featured regular tour stalwarts SebastiAn and Kavinsky and were ultimately the fastest selling Daft Punk-related events to date. The tour eventually culminated in Sydney at the Showground Main Arena. 
Daft Punk mixed and composed much of the music for the Louis Vuitton Spring/Summer 2008 Womenswear Full Show on 7 October 2007. The duo later stated in an EMI-sponsored live webchat that there would be no tour performances for 2008, and that they would instead focus on new projects. 

Daft Punk made a surprise appearance at the 50th Grammy Awards on 10 February 2008. The duo appeared with Kanye West to perform a reworked version of ""Stronger"" on stage at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. For the appearance, Daft Punk utilized four JazzMutant Lemur controllers. A press release specified that this was the first televised live performance by the duo in their career. Bangalter's wife Élodie Bouchez also attended the event. 
In February 2009, a website stated that a ""hidden"" tour had been set for 2009. An event for 13 February 2009 in Shanghai, China was mentioned in the website. It was later revealed to be a hoax unaffiliated with Daft Punk and a scam to sell tickets for a nonexistent event. Representatives of the band announced that Daft Punk had no tour plans for 2009, but stated that the duo was looking forward to performing in China during their next world tour ""in 2010 or 2011"". The announcement also stated that all of Daft Punk's shows are and would be posted on their official MySpace page, and that the page can therefore be used to verify validity. In September 2010, The Daily Swarm reported that the duo would perform live sets in major cities to promote the film Tron: Legacy. 
Daft Punk made a surprise guest appearance during the encore of Phoenix's show of 20 October 2010 at Madison Square Garden in New York City. They played a medley of ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"" and ""Around the World"" before the song segued into Phoenix's song ""1901"". The duo also included elements of their tracks ""Rock'n Roll"", ""Human After All"", as well as one of Bangalter's side projects, ""Together"". 
Daft Punk performed at the 56th Grammy Awards ceremony on 26 January 2014. The duo's performance featured Stevie Wonder, Nile Rodgers, Pharrell Williams as well as Random Access Memories session musicians Nathan East, Omar Hakim, Paul Jackson, Jr. and Chris Caswell. The ensemble performed the Grammy-winning ""Get Lucky"" before moving into a medley consisting of Chic's ""Le Freak"" and Stevie Wonder's ""Another Star"" as well as elements of Daft Punk's ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"", ""Lose Yourself to Dance"", and ""Around the World"". The stage backdrop used for the performance was designed by Daft Arts to resemble a recording studio, incorporating a functioning mixing console operated by Daft Punk. 

Appearances in media and tributes:

Daft Punk's popularity has been partially attributed to their appearances in mainstream media. The duo appeared with Juliette Lewis in an advertisement for The Gap, featuring the single ""Digital Love"", and were contractually obliged to appear only in Gap clothing. In the summer of 2001, Daft Punk appeared in an advertisement on Cartoon Network's Toonami timeslot, promoting the official Toonami website and the duo's animated music videos for their album Discovery. The music videos later appeared as scenes in the feature-length film Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem, in which Daft Punk make a cameo appearance as their robot alter-egos. The duo later appeared in a television advertisement wearing their Discovery-era headgear to promote Sony Ericsson's Premini mobile phone. Their robotic costumes also make an appearance in the ""Masterclass"" section on Chilly Gonzales' 2006 DVD release From Major to Minor. In 2010, Daft Punk appeared in Adidas advertisements promoting a Star Wars-themed clothing line. 
The duo has also been acknowledged in works by other artists. ""Losing My Edge"", the first single by LCD Soundsystem, bragged about being the first to ""play Daft Punk to the rock kids."" LCD Soundsystem also recorded the song ""Daft Punk Is Playing at My House"", which reached No. 29 in the UK and was nominated for the 2006 Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording. The Soulwax remix of the song also contains samples of many Daft Punk tracks as well as tracks by Thomas Bangalter. The song ""Number 1 Girl"" by the Dutch music project Le Le mentions the names Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo among other producers and artists. In the Flight of the Conchords episode ""Sally"", a music video for the Flight of the Conchords song ""Robots"" is shot with homemade robot costumes fashioned by the band's manager, Murray. Jemaine comments, ""It doesn't look like Daft Punk. We wanted ones like Daft Punk."" 
A number of Daft Punk tracks have been sampled or covered by other artists. ""Technologic"" was sampled by Swizz Beatz for the Busta Rhymes song ""Touch It"". In a later remix of ""Touch It"" the line ""touch it, bring it, pay it, watch it, turn it, leave it, start, format it"" from ""Technologic"" was sung by R&B and rap artist Missy Elliott. Kanye West's 2007 song ""Stronger"" from the album Graduation features a vocal sample of Daft Punk's ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"". Daft Punk's robotic costumes make an appearance in the music video for ""Stronger"". The track ""Daftendirekt"" from Daft Punk's album Homework was sampled for the Janet Jackson song ""So Much Betta"" from her 2008 album Discipline. The track ""Aerodynamic"" was sampled for Wiley's 2008 single ""Summertime"". ""Veridis Quo"" from the album Discovery was sampled for the Jazmine Sullivan song ""Dream Big"" from her 2008 album Fearless. DJs Marc Mysterio and Téo Moss released a cover version of ""One More Time"" featuring the vocals of Yardi Don. Daft Punk's ""Around the World"" was sampled for JoJo's 2009 song ""You Take Me (Around the World)"". The song ""Cowboy George"" by The Fall contains a clip of ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"". 
Daft Punk has also produced music for other artists. They produced the Teriyaki Boyz's debut single ""HeartBreaker"" on the album Beef or Chicken?. The song contains a sample of ""Human After All"". Daft Punk later produced N.E.R.D's song ""Hypnotize U"". Daft Punk are featured on the cover of the December 2010 issue of British publication Dazed & Confused to promote the film Tron: Legacy, for which the duo composed the score. They also made a cameo appearance within the film as masked DJs at the ""End of Line"" nightclub. 
In 2011, Coca-Cola distributed limited edition bottles designed by Daft Punk, called Daft Coke. They were only sold in France. A newer version of these themed bottles now exist as collectors items, some parts of the bottles such as the cap and Coke logo being plated in gold. In a December 2012 episode of The Simpsons titled ""The Day the Earth Stood Cool"", recurring character Disco Stu wears an outfit which is very similar in design to Bangalter's. The online role-playing game World of Warcraft references the musicians with non-player characters Guyo Crystalgear and Tivilix Bangalter, which wear distinctive diving suits and helmets based on the duo's signature appearance. Daft Punk, along with Courtney Love were photographed for the ""Music Project"" of fashion house Yves Saint Laurent. The duo appear in their new sequined suits custom made by Hedi Slimane, holding and playing their new instruments with bodies made of lucite. In 2013, Bandai Tamashii released a SHF (Chogokin) action figure for Daft Punk coinciding with the release of Random Access Memories in Japan. Following a series a teaser trailers, Daft Punk made a rare public appearance at the 2013 Monaco Grand Prix in May on behalf of the Lotus F1 Team, who supported the duo by racing in specially-branded cars emblazoned with the band's logo. Daft Punk were scheduled to appear on the episode of The Colbert Report on 6 August to promote Random Access Memories, but were unable to do so because of contractual obligations regarding the duo's later appearance at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards. According to Stephen Colbert, Daft Punk were unaware of any exclusivity agreement and were halted by MTV executives the morning prior to the taping. 
In the 2014 animated film My Little Pony: Equestria Girls - Rainbow Rocks, the character Rarity briefly dons an outfit with a helmet similar to that of de Homem-Christo. The 2014 French drama film Eden includes appearances by two actors who portray Daft Punk at various points in their career. 
A cappella group Pentatonix performed a medley of Daft Punk songs, released as a YouTube video. As of November 2014, the video had been viewed over 100 million times. The medley won for Best Arrangement, Instrumental or a Cappella of the 57th Grammy Awards.]",0.355090701452,0.845468,"[house, filter house, electronic, electro house, edm, electro]",0.866681,0.0692227724871,0.739727824938,0.697679200395,0.682290425562,0.530088303794,9.0,0.380577519075,0.638852883992,0.0,0.0504039899977,0.719751014128,4.0,0.402600511218,1
